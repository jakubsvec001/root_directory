      "the northern river shark or new guinea river shark glyphis garricki is species of requiem shark in the family carcharhinidae found in scattered tidal rivers and associated coastal waters in northern australia and in papua new guinea this species inhabits areas with poor visibility soft bottoms and large tides with immature sharks ranging into fresh and brackish water it is similar to other river sharks in having stocky grey body with high back tiny eyes and broad fins it measures up to long northern river sharks are likely piscivorous this species is viviparous with females bearing litters of young possibly every other year before the wet season very rare and facing threats from commercial and recreational fishing and perhaps also habitat degradation this species has been assessed as critically endangered by the international union for conservation of nature taxonomy the first known specimens of the northern river shark two newborn males from papua new guinea were discovered by new zealand ichthyologist jack garrick after whom the species was eventually named this shark was referred to as glyphis sp until when it was formally described by leonard compagno william white and peter last in commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation paper the type specimen is female long collected from the east alligator river kakadu national park northern territory distribution and habitat the northern river shark has been reported from king sound the ord river and doctors creek near derby western australia the adelaide and alligator rivers in australia northern territory and the daru region and possibly the fly river in papua new guinea it inhabits large rivers estuaries and coastal bays all of which are characterized by high turbidity silty or muddy bottoms and large tides young and juvenile sharks are found in fresh brackish and salt water salinity ranging from to ppt whereas adults have only been found in marine environments description like other members of its genus the northern river shark has stocky body with high back the head is wide and flattened with broadly rounded snout and minute eyes equipped with nictitating membranes each nostril is divided into very large incurrent opening and small excurrent opening by triangular skin flap the sizable mouth is broadly arched with short furrows at the corners thirty one to tooth rows are in the upper jaw and tooth rows are in the lower jaw the upper teeth are upright and triangular with serrated edges while the lower teeth are narrower and straight to slightly curved in the largest individuals the first few lower teeth from the jaw median are spear shaped with serrations near the tip the pectoral fins are large and broad with gently backward curving margins and pointed tips the pelvic fins are triangular with nearly straight trailing margins the first dorsal fin is long based and triangular with the apex almost forming right angle the second dorsal fin is some two thirds as high as the first the origin of the first dorsal fin lies over the pectoral fin insertions while that of second dorsal fin lies over the pelvic fin rear tips no ridge exists between the dorsal fins the anal fin is smaller than the second dorsal fin and has strong notch in the rear margin the caudal fin has strong lower lobe and long narrow upper lobe with ventral notch near the tip the dermal denticles are small oval and overlapping bearing three horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth this shark is steel gray above and white below the color transition is sharp located well below the eye and becomes jagged on the sides of the trunk the anal and caudal fins become dusky or black towards the trailing margins and tips the maximum known length is this species differs from the speartooth shark glyphis in several morphological and meristic characters including having fewer vertebrae versus and lower jagged gray white color boundary biology and ecology with its slender teeth small eyes and high density of ampullae of lorenzini the northern river shark seems to be adapted for hunting fish in conditions of poor visibility in doctors creek sharks may move to and from favored feeding areas with the tide like other requiem sharks this species is viviparous with the developing embryos forming placental connection to their mother after exhausting their supply of yolk females give birth around october before the start of the wet season on possibly biennial cycle one female examined contained nine fetuses the young are born at under long males mature between lengths of while females mature between lengths of human interactions the northern river shark appears to be extremely rare though more subpopulations may remain to be discovered in australia and papua new guinea based on present information no more than mature individuals are estimated to exist in the wild with no more than in any particular subpopulation this species is caught legally and illegally by commercial fisheries using longlines and gillnets as well as by recreational fishers habitat degradation may pose further threat to its survival because of its low natural abundance limited distribution stringent habitat requirements and susceptibility to various human caused threats the iucn has assessed the northern river shark as critically endangered it has also been listed as endangered on the commonwealth environment protection and biodiversity conservation act and on the territory parks and wildlife conservation act kakadu national park may be an important protected

      "open data map linked open data cloud in august clear labeling of the licensing terms is key component of open data and icons like the one pictured here are being used for that purpose open data is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish without restrictions from copyright patents or other mechanisms of control the goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other open movements such as open source open hardware open content open education open educational resources open government open knowledge open access open science and the open web paradoxically the growth of the open data movement is paralleled by rise in intellectual property rights the philosophy behind open data has been long established for example in the mertonian tradition of science but the term open data itself is recent gaining popularity with the rise of the internet and world wide web and especially with the launch of open data government initiatives such as data gov data gov uk and data gov in open data can also be linked data when it is it is linked open data one of the most important forms of open data is open government data which is form of open data created by ruling government institutions open government data importance is borne from it being part of citizens everyday lives down to the most routine mundane tasks that are seemingly far removed from government overview the concept of open data is not new but formalized definition is one definition is the open definition which can be summarized in the statement that piece of data is open if anyone is free to use reuse and redistribute it subject only at most to the requirement to attribute and or share alike other definitions including the open data institute open data is data that anyone can access use or share have an accessible short version of the definition but refer to the formal definition open data may include non textual material such as maps genomes connectomes chemical compounds mathematical and scientific formulae medical data and practice bioscience and biodiversity problems often arise because these are commercially valuable or can be aggregated into works of value access to or re use of the data is controlled by organisations both public and private control may be through access restrictions licenses copyright patents and charges for access or re use advocates of open data argue that these restrictions are against the common good and that these data should be made available without restriction or fee in addition it is important that the data are re usable without requiring further permission though the types of re use such as the creation of derivative works may be controlled by license typical depiction of the need for open data creators of data often do not consider the need to state the conditions of ownership licensing and re use instead presuming that not asserting copyright puts the data into the public domain for example many scientists do not regard the published data arising from their work to be theirs to control and consider the act of publication in journal to be an implicit release of data into the commons however the lack of license makes it difficult to determine the status of data set and may restrict the use of data offered in an open spirit because of this uncertainty it is also possible for public or private organizations to aggregate said data protect it with copyright and then resell it the issue of indigenous knowledge ik poses great challenge in terms of capturing storage and distribution many societies in third world countries lack the technicality processes of managing the ik at his presentation at the xml conference connolly displayed these two quotations regarding open data want my data back jon bosak circa ve long believed that customers of any application own the data they enter into it this quote refers to veen own heart rate data major sources open data can come from any source this section lists some of the fields that publish or at least discuss publishing large amount of open data in science the concept of open access to scientific data was institutionally established with the formation of the world data center system in preparation for the international geophysical year of the international council of scientific unions now the international council for science oversees several world data centres with the mandate to minimize the risk of data loss and to maximize data accessibility while the open science data movement long predates the internet the availability of fast ubiquitous networking has significantly changed the context of open science data since publishing or obtaining data has become much less expensive and time consuming the human genome project was major initiative that exemplified the power of open data it was built upon the so called bermuda principles stipulating that all human genomic sequence information should be freely available and in the public domain in order to encourage research and development and to maximise its benefit to society more recent initiatives such as the structural genomics consortium have illustrated that the open data approach can also be used productively within the context of industrial in the science ministers of all nations of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd which includes most developed countries of the world signed declaration which essentially states that all publicly funded archive data should be made publicly available following request and an intense discussion with data producing institutions in member states the oecd published in the oecd principles and guidelines for access to research data from public funding as soft law recommendation examples of open data in science the dataverse network project archival repository software promoting data sharing persistent data citation and reproducible research data uni muenster de open data about scientific artifacts from university of muenster germany launched in linkedscience org data open scientific datasets encoded as linked data launched in in government there are range of different arguments for government open data for example some advocates contend that making government information available to the public as machine readable open data can facilitate government transparency accountability and public participation open data can be powerful force for public accountability it can make existing information easier to analyze process and combine than ever before allowing new level of public scrutiny governments that enable public viewing of data can help citizens engage within the governmental sectors and add value to that data some make the case that opening up official information can support technological innovation and economic growth by enabling third parties to develop new kinds of digital applications and services several national governments have created web sites to distribute portion of the data they collect it is concept for collaborative project in municipal government to create and organize culture for open data or open government data additionally other levels of government have established open data websites there are many government entities pursuing open data in canada data gov lists the sites of total of us states and us cities and counties with web sites to provide open data the state of maryland the state of california us at the international level the united nations has an open data website that publishes statistical data from member states and un agencies and the world bank published range of statistical data relating to developing countries the european commission has created two portals for the european union the eu open data portal which gives access to open data from the eu institutions agencies and other bodies and the publicdata portal that provides datasets from local regional and national public bodies across europe in october the open government partnership launched the international open data charter set of principles and best practices for the release of governmental open data formally adopted by seventeen governments of countries states and cities during the ogp global summit in mexico arguments for and against the debate on open data is still evolving the best open government applications seek to empower citizens to help small businesses or to create value in some other positive constructive way opening government data is only way point on the road to improving education improving government and building tools to solve other real world problems while many arguments have been made categorically the following discussion of arguments for and against open data highlights that these arguments often depend highly on the type of data and its potential uses arguments made on behalf of open data include the following data belong to the human race typical examples are genomes data on organisms medical science environmental data following the aarhus convention public money was used to fund the work and so it should be universally available it was created by or at government institution this is common in us national laboratories and government agencies facts cannot legally be copyrighted sponsors of research do not get full value unless the resulting data are freely available restrictions on data re use create an anticommons data are required for the smooth process of running communal human activities and are an important enabler of socio economic development health care education economic productivity etc in scientific research the rate of discovery is accelerated by better access to data making data open helps combat data rot and ensure that scientific research data are preserved over time it is generally held that factual data cannot be copyrighted however publishers frequently add copyright statements often forbidding re use to scientific data accompanying publications it may be unclear whether the factual data embedded in full text are part of the copyright while the human abstraction of facts from paper publications is normally accepted as legal there is often an implied restriction on the machine extraction by robots unlike open access where groups of publishers have stated their concerns open data is normally challenged by individual institutions their arguments have been discussed less in public discourse and there are fewer quotes to rely on at this time arguments against making all data available as open data include the following government funding may not be used to duplicate or challenge the activities of the private sector pubchem governments have to be accountable for the efficient use of taxpayer money if public funds are used to aggregate the data and if the data will bring commercial private benefits to only small number of users the users should reimburse governments for the cost of providing the data the revenue earned by publishing data can be used to cover the costs of generating and or disseminating the data so that the dissemination can continue indefinitely the revenue earned by publishing data permits non profit organisations to fund other activities learned society publishing supports the society the government gives specific legitimacy for certain organisations to recover costs nist in us ordnance survey in uk privacy concerns may require that access to data is limited to specific users or to sub sets of the data collecting cleaning managing and disseminating data are typically labour and or cost intensive processes whoever provides these services should receive fair remuneration for providing those services sponsors do not get full value unless their data is used appropriately sometimes this requires quality management dissemination and branding efforts that can best be achieved by charging fees to users often targeted end users cannot use the data without additional processing analysis apps etc if anyone has access to the data none may have an incentive to invest in the processing required to make data useful typical examples include biological medical and environmental data relation to other open activities the goals of the open data movement are similar to those of other open movements open access is concerned with making scholarly publications freely available on the internet in some cases these articles include open datasets as well open content is concerned with making resources aimed at human audience such as prose photos or videos freely available open knowledge open knowledge international argues for openness in range of issues including but not limited to those of open data it covers scientific historical geographic or otherwise content such as music films books government and other administrative information open data is included within the scope of the open knowledge definition which is alluded to in science commons protocol for implementing open access data open notebook science refers to the application of the open data concept to as much of the scientific process as possible including failed experiments and raw experimental data open source software is concerned with the licenses under which computer programs can be distributed and is not normally concerned primarily with data open educational resources are freely accessible openly licensed documents and media that are useful for teaching learning and assessing as well as for research purposes open research open science open science data linked open science means an approach to open and interconnect scientific assets like data methods and tools with linked data techniques to enable transparent reproducible and research funders mandates several funding bodies which mandate open access also mandate open data good expression of requirements truncated in places is given by the canadian institutes of health research cihr to deposit bioinformatics atomic and molecular coordinate data experimental data into the appropriate public database immediately upon publication of research results to retain original data sets for minimum of five years after the grant this applies to all data whether published or not other bodies active in promoting the deposition of data as well as fulltext include the wellcome trust an academic paper published in advocated that horizon the science funding mechanism of the eu due to launch in should mandate that funded projects hand in their databases as deliverables at the end of the project so that they can be checked for third party usability then shared non open data several mechanisms restrict access to or reuse of data and several reasons for doing this are given above they include making data available for charge compilation in databases or websites to which only registered members or customers can have access use of proprietary or closed technology or encryption which creates barrier for access copyright forbidding or obfuscating re use of the data including the use of no derivatives requirements patent forbidding re use of the data for example the dimensional coordinates of some experimental protein structures have been patented restriction of robots to websites with preference to certain search engines aggregating factual data into databases which may be covered by database rights or database directives directive on the legal protection of databases time limited access to resources such as journals which on traditional print were available to the purchaser indefinitely webstacles or the provision of single data points as opposed to tabular queries or bulk downloads of data sets political commercial or legal pressure on the

      "day fine day fine unit fine or structured fine is unit of fine payment that above minimum fine is based on the offender daily personal income crime is punished with incarceration for determined number of days or with fines as incarceration is financial punishment in the effect of preventing work day fine represents one day incarcerated and without salary it is argued to be just because if both high income and low income population are punished with the same jail time they should also be punished with proportionally similar income loss an analogy may be drawn with income tax which is also proportional to the income even progressively jurisdictions employing the day fine include finland estonia sweden denmark germany switzerland and macao distribution unit fine systems are common and standard in many jurisdictions across the world notably in fenno scandinavia where it originated in in finland and in commonwealth countries such as australia and new zealand finland both police and the finnish border guard can make formal demand for fining person or order petty fine in finland the day fine system is used for most crimes that are punishable by way of fine the system has been in use since most minor infractions are punished with fixed petty fine rikesakko ordningsbot such as minor traffic and water traffic violations littering and breaches of public peace petty fine is summarily ordered by the police officer if the suspect does not contest his guilt but the person punished may contest the fine in district court finnish prosecutors have considerable judicial power in deciding fines here prosecutors are arriving at court of law most infractions are punishable with day fine for crimes warranting no more than six months in prison the fine may be summarily ordered by the prosecutor if the suspect does not want the court to handle the case the process of ordering day fine is started by police officer who makes formal demand for the suspect to be fined the suspect has one week to contest the demand if the suspect does not contest the demand the prosecutor may order fine which may not be higher than demanded by the police officer if the suspect contests the demand the case may be taken to the district court if the prosecutor considers the suspect guilty if the prosecutor considers the case to merit term in prison or higher fine the case is always taken to the court if the prosecution or the injured party do not demand higher punishment than fine the district court has quorum with single member the fine is paid to the bank using giro fine ordered in finland is executable in any european union member country finnish fine consists of minimum of day fine up to maximum of day fines if several crimes are punished together day fines may be sentenced the fines may not be sentenced together with prison sentence unless the prison sentence is probational the minimum amount of day fine is euros usually the day fine is one half of daily disposable income the daily disposable income is considered to be one th part of the person monthly mean income during the year after taxes social security payments and basic living allowance of per month have been deducted in addition every person for whose upkeep the fined person is responsible decreases the amount of daily fine by the income of the person is calculated on the basis of the latest taxation data for speeding in traffic however the fine is at least as high as the petty fine the person who is punished with fine is responsible for giving accurate information concerning their income lying about one income is crime punishable with fine or up to three months in prison the police can however access the taxation data of finnish citizens and permanent residents via real time datalink so the chance of lying successfully is minor there is no maximum day fine which may lead to considerably high fines for high income persons for example in finnish businessman with yearly income of million euros received relatively mild punishment of six day fines amounting for driving though red traffic light in businessman was fined for travelling at kilometres per hour in an area with speed limit of kilometres per hour as speeding is punished with petty fine if the offender is exceeding the speed limit by up to km but with day fine if exceeding the limit by km or more the monetary amount of the fine can increase from to over although the actual change in speed is less than km this has given rise to some criticism most vividly expressed by finnish member of parliament avid motorist klaus bremer and other mps of right wing parties the fines are subject to recovery proceedings if the fines are still not paid the court may convert them to prison sentence three day fines will be converted to one day of imprisonment ignoring the remainder for any amount of day fines not divisible by three and the length of the sentence must be between and days this conversion punishment is only ever applied to court ordered fines not those issued by police macao article of the penal code portuguese specifies that criminal fine portuguese shall normally be at least days and at most days one day fine costs at least macanese patacas and at most patacas court of law imposes the fine based on the economic and financial situations and personal burdens of convict united kingdom england and wales experimented with the system for short period from to it was unpopular with both magistrates and the general public and was soon abandoned the scheme was replaced by requirements that magistrates consider an offender means when imposing fine just not according to mathematical formula united states the new york times reported on an experience with day fines which took place in in staten island which was partnership between the local courts and district attorney and the vera institute of justice implementing day fines in india day fines are concept to which little thought has been given in india undeniably prisons are overcrowded and represent religious minorities and socio economically vulnerable castes and tribal groups it is however unclear how much of this is due to fines the ipc provides some safeguards on imposing fines such as monetary caps on fines for some offences and stringent limits for imprisonment for non payment of fines where no upper monetary caps are specified the ipc does not gives courts discretion to impose fines which are unlimited but not excessive while specific fine amounts would require to be done away with in the text of the ipc several underlying

      "the panjshir offensives panjsher operations were series of battles between the soviet army and groups of afghan mujahideen under ahmad shah massoud for the control of the strategic panjshir valley during the soviet war in afghanistan in the period from to these battles saw some of the most violent fighting of the whole war during the nine campaigns launched coordinated soviet assaults would regularly drive out the mujahideen from the valley but they would return as soon as the soviets left strategic objective the panjshir valley lies km north of kabul in the hindu kush mountains close to the salang pass which connects kabul to the northern areas of afghanistan and further on to uzbekistan then part of the soviet union in june an insurrection led by ahmed shah massoud expelled all government forces and the valley became guerrilla stronghold from the panjshir mujahideen groups frequently carried out ambushes against soviet convoys bringing supplies to the th army stationed in afghanistan the salang pass became dangerous area and soviet truck drivers were even awarded decorations for having successfully crossed it the pressure on the logistic system determined the soviet command to try and dislodge the rebels soviet strategy soviet offensives into the panjshir valley had three main tactical features there was the concentration of air assets including extensive aerial bombardment of target area followed by the landing of helicopter forces to stop the withdrawal of enemy forces and engage the enemy from unexpected directions and drive by of mechanized forces into areas of guerrilla support in conjunction with the helicopter landing parties it was these kinds of tactics that caused so much destruction in the civilian populations in these regions by forcing the mass migration of civilians from the panjshir valley and destroying all crops and livestock the soviets hoped to deprive ahmad shah massoud of resources to sustain his full time fighters shortcomings of soviet strategy this tactic had some success as massoud was forced to sign cease fire treaty in january that would last for one year in order to rebuild his organization the bottom line though was that these victories were very temporary there were serious issues with this tactic of large punitive offensives that contributed to the stalemate that characterized the war mujahideen forces would often learn of coming offensives in advance from their compatriots in the dra army not only could civilians and guerrillas move safely out of the way of the majority of the bombs but guerrillas could also plan ambushes lay mines and move weapons caches once armored personnel carriers and helicopters came the guerrillas would retreat into the side valleys and carry out small ambushes rather than openly confront the soviets timeline panjshir september panjshir ii october panjshir iii march the first three offensives were small scale operations involving only four battalions the mujahideen who weren strong enough to confront the soviet army in the open blended in with the local population and generally waited until the soviets had left to resume their activities panjshir iv september by this time massoud had mustered enough men to openly resist the soviet assault during this offensive to avoid losing vehicles to land mines the soviets sent their sapper units to clear the way in front of the main force this tactic proved costly and the attack force penetrated only km into the valley before retiring after having suffered casualties panjshir may the first major offensive was carried out by force of soldiers under the command of general ter grigoryan supported by helicopters and airplanes the main assault began on the night of may after an intense aviation and artillery bombardment while motorized rifle battalions preceded by reconnaissance units attacked the dominating features at the entrance of the valley airborne units were airlifted by helicopter behind the main mujahideen defenses in all troops were airlifted into the valley to capture strategic points right up to the pakistani border in an effort to cut the mujahideen supply lines in some areas the fighting was intense when soviet paratrooper regiment landed east of rukha it was quickly encircled and suffered significant losses the beleaguered paratroopers were saved only by the arrival of motorised rifle battalion led by major aushev who forced his way through the mujahideen defenses consisting of well located strong points and captured rukha for his actions aushev was awarded the title of hero of the soviet union massoud who expected an attack similar to the previous ones had disposed his defenses close to the entrance of the valley and was thus unable to prevent the soviets from gaining footholds in the panjshir they established three main bases at rukha bazarak and anava most of the mujahideen had survived the attack and massoud divided them into small mobile groups that fought the soviets all down the valley during this offensive the soviets managed to occupy large part of the panjshir and scored some successes against massoud organization such as the capture of list of the names of of his agents in kabul however most of the rebels had escaped capture and this was not the decisive victory the soviets had been hoping for also their heavily fortified bases only gave them control over the valley floor while the surrounding heights were still held by the mujahideen for this reason they decided to launch sixth offensive panjshir vi august september the sixth offensive consisted of series of sweeps conducted by motorized units and by airborne spetsnaz units launched from their bases in the panjshir to find and destroy the mujahideen hideouts it was accompanied by heavy aerial bombardment of villages suspected of harbouring rebel groups notably carried out by tu bombers flying from inside the soviet union airborne troops carried out search and destroy missions encircling massoud mobile units and destroying some of them however as rule attrition among the mujahideen was low and the brunt of the attacks fell on the civilian population who suffered heavily many of them preferring to flee the valley despite bitter fighting the soviets were unable to eradicate the mujahideen and the battle soon developed into stalemate during the th and th offensives the soviets suffered up to casualties and afghan army soldiers defected to the mujahideen once the height of the offensive had passed many areas captured by the soviet forces were handed over to afghan army units who suffered from low morale and high desertion rates they were the targets for massoud counterattacks in series of surprise attacks several government outposts fell to the rebels the first was the afghan army outpost at saricha which the mujahideen captured along with prisoners and tanks despite having to cross minefield the government post at birjaman fell soon after and the mujahideen were able to recapture some areas in this way these operations along with the continued harassment of soviet garrisons and resupply convoys proved that the mujahideen were far from defeated and convinced the soviets that they must negotiate truce with massoud in january for the first time ceasefire was concluded between the soviets and the mujahideen lasting months and later extended negotiated by massoud in person with colonel of the gru anatoly tkachev the agreement stipulated that soviet troops should evacuate the panjshir except for small garrison at anava whose access was controlled by the mujahideen the area covered by the ceasefire included the panjshir valley but not the salang pass where fighting continued massoud took advantage of the truce to extend his influence over areas that had until then been held by hostile factions loyal to gulbuddin hekmatyar hezb islami party like in andarab district more peacefully he took control of the khost fereng sector and some areas in southern takhar province while establishing contacts with other guerrilla groups in baghlan province and persuading them to adopt his military organisation he also ordered the strengthening of defenses in five subsidiary valleys as well as in the panjshir permitting defense in depth and withdrew his headquarters to shira mandara in takhar province in anticipation of renewed assault panjshir vii april to september in february konstantin chernenko replaced yuri andropov as general secretary of the communist party of the soviet union while andropov had supported the ceasefire chernenko disciple of brezhnev believed that the guerrillas should be rooted out through military action an opinion which he shared with babrak karmal president of the dra as result new offensive was planned which in karmal words should be decisive and merciless and in order to destroy the panjshir valley bases all those living there should be killed it was the largest offensive in the region to date however some soviets who were supporters of andropov disagreed with this policy and they gave massoud advance warning of the attack through this channel and thanks to his agents in the dra government massoud had precise idea of the soviet plans and he was able to counter them to avoid civilian casualties all inhabitants of the panjshir from population of before the war were evacuated to safe areas only ambush parties were left to delay the soviet advance all the roads villages and helicopter landing zones were heavily mined all these preparations were carried out in secret and token activity was maintained near the soviet base at anava to deceive the soviets into believing that conventional defense was being prepared soviet and afghan soldiers under marshal of the soviet union sergei sokolov participated in the offensive supported by airplanes and helicopters on april after two day bombardment of the region by tu tu and su bombers they advanced rapidly into the panjshir several battalion strength forces were placed at key passes leading out of the panjshir valley while at the same time large helicopter troop landings were made in tributary valleys connected to the panjshir by blocking the mujahideen withdrawal routes and securing the high ground the soviets forced them higher into the mountains then they had previously ventured and scattered their strength as they attempted to avoid being trapped by the helicopter landings once the strength of massoud forces were dealt such deadly blow rather than withdrawing from the valley as they had previously done they began setting up system of forts and posts throughout the main valley while relinquishing control of the side valleys these tactics proved more effective at rooting out insurgents and breaking up their fighting forces during the offensive but had limited long term success the forts and outposts along the panjshir valley were unable to protect roads and convoys as well as they had hoped and these installations proved attractive targets for the mujahideen to harass much of the valley was occupied but the soviets paid heavy price many soldiers were killed by mines and in ambushes during one battle on april in the hazara valley the st battalion of the nd motor rifle regiment was decimated the losses of soviet troops were estimated at killed for the soviets the operation was partly successful some of the infrastructure of the mujahideen created in the time of the truce in was destroyed babrak karmal completed propaganda visit to the panjshir which for some time had become safe zone however it quickly became apparent that most of massoud forces had escaped the onslaught and were still able to carry out their harassment tactics eventually in september the soviet dra forces once again evacuated the panjshir valley leaving occupying forces only in the lower panjshir yousaf and adkin reported in that the soviet forces involved included the th motor rifle regiment battalions of the th motor rifle brigade and st motor rifle regiment regiment of the rd guards airborne division battalion of the th independent guards airborne regiment accompanied by afghan forces including the th division the th division and the th commando brigade it seems likely that the reference to the th motor rifle regiment refers to the nd motor rifle regiment of the th motor rifle division based in kabul panjshir viii september the th offensive was follow up to the th involving mostly airborne forces panjshir ix june the th offensive was carried out in reprisal for the destruction of the dra garrison at peshgur during which massoud mobile groups took prisoners including officers and killed brigadier of the afghan army the prisoners had been marched into the mountains where the mujahideen claimed they were killed by soviet aerial bombardment claim others dubbed suspicious initiated hours after the raid the soviet counter attack installed new garrison in peshgur and pursued the retreating mujahideen the group escorting the captured afghan officers was caught in the open by soviet helicopters and in the ensuing fight most of the prisoners were killed with both sides projecting on each other the responsibility for the incident aftermath in mikhail gorbachev announced his intention of withdrawing the soviet contingent from afghanistan from then on the soviets were mostly concerned with avoiding losses in the panjshir sector and they observed tacit ceasefire unprovoked shooting by soviet troops was forbidden and the mujahideen refrained from attacking soviet bases despite provocations ordered by najibullah government to draw the soviets into further fighting the situation generally remained calm enabling massoud to carry out his strategic offensive capturing much of baghlan and takhar provinces the last soviet and afghan troops present in the lower panjshir were finally evacuated in june references external links the afghanistan war

      "liquid capacitive inclinometers are inclinometers or clinometers whose sensing elements are made with liquid filled differential capacitor they sense the local direction of acceleration due to gravity or movement capacitive inclinometer has disc like cavity that is partly filled with dielectric liquid one of the sides of the cavity has an etched conductor plate that is used to form one of the conductors of variable parallel plate capacitor the liquid along with the other side of the cavity forms the other plate of the capacitor in operation the sensor is mounted so that the disc is in vertical plane with its axis horizontal gravity then acts on the liquid pulling it down in the cavity forming semicircle as the sensor is rotated the liquid remains in this semicircular pattern covering different area of the etched plate this change in area results in change in the capacitance the change in capacitance is then electronically converted into an output signal that is linear with respect to the input angle references external links diagram of liquid capacitive inclinometer\n",

      "the market for liberty is an anarcho capitalist book written by linda and morris tannehill which according to karl hess has become something of classic it was preceded by the self published liberty via the market in mary ruwart credits the tannehill book with winning her over to anarcho capitalism doug casey was also converted to anarcho capitalism after reading the book at the behest of jarret wollstein according to the ludwig von mises institute it was written just following period of intense study of the writings of both ayn rand and murray rothbard it was the first significant anarcho capitalist work to hit the libertarian movement coming into print year before rothbard power and market although rothbard book had been written earlier like rothbard man economy and state the market for liberty opposes statutory law and advocates natural law as the basis for society however unlike man economy and state which explains what sort of libertarian legal code the market would create in an anarcho capitalist society the market for liberty points out that society would not be lawless in the absence of the state conversely the market for liberty spends great deal of time outlining how different businesses and organizational structures would interact in laissez faire society and how these interactions would create checks which would ultimately keep the tendency for crime low in keeping with radical free market principles the book is skeptical about the potential for violent anarcho capitalist revolution to bring about good outcomes summary part the great conflict chapter if we don know where we re going notes the growing dissatisfaction among youth the many problems society faces and the need for clear goal rather than just an adversary the state it claims that the authors are not advocating any type of utopia that depends on the infallibility of man in order to function it contends that if the present system is brought crashing down without valid ideas having been disseminated about how society can function without governmental rule people will demand strong leader and hitler will rise to answer their plea chapter man and society argues that the nature of man is such that he must think and produce in order to live and that in order to reach his full potential he must have the right not only to do these things but to enjoy the rewards of his productive actions it defines laissez faire society as one that does not the initiation of force and in which there are means for dealing with aggression justly when it does occur it notes that only the possessor of right can alienate himself from that right if one does of damage to taxicab for instance then he alienates himself from his right to that the cabbie then has moral right to use force to collect it chapter the self regulating market states that state interference causes the buyer the seller or both in transaction to lose and that only voluntary trade can be completely satisfactory trade it notes that markets clear that taxation is economic hemophilia regulation amounts to slow strangulation that market monopolies can only attain and maintain monopoly status through excellence and low prices and that without freedom of the market no other freedom is meaningful it criticizes the government for red tape which denies entrepreneurs opportunities to rise out of poverty chapter government an unnecessary evil states that government is coercive monopoly that democratic governments decide issues largely on the basis of pressure from special interest groups and that the notion of government of laws not of men is meaningless because laws must be written and enforced by men and therefore government of laws is government of men it argues that the eternal vigilance which is held to be the price of liberty is constant non productive expenditure of energy and that is it grossly unreasonable to expect men to keep expending their energy in such way out of unselfish idealism it also argues that because of the danger of one interest group using the government to impose laws favoring itself or crippling its opponents people are constantly in fear of different interest groups thus blacks fear suppression by whites whites worry about blacks gaining too much power and any number of other groups such as labor and management urbanites and suburbanites etc are pitted against each other government is identified as cause of strife the checks and balances of government are also recognized as source of waste that is no substitute for external checks such as competition this chapter identifies many tools by which the government convinces people that government is necessary such as state schools that brainwash the young into accepting pro state ideas investing government with tradition and pomp and identifying it with our way of life it also blames people for having fear of self responsibility part ii laissez faire society chapter free and healthy economy begins by noting the difficulties people have in picturing society radically different from their own it concludes that poverty would be better addressed by laissez faire society for many reasons including the fact that unemployment is caused by the government that untaxed businesses would have more profits to reinvest in productivity enhancing technology that private charities are more efficient than government that parents would be more likely to avoid having excess children in the absence of social safety nets etc it argues that plethora of choices in education would emerge in free market it also notes that the focus of media in laissez faire society would shift from covering government to covering business and individuals and that abuses would be checked by reporters looking for stories on aggression or fraud the chapter argues that the quality of health care could be more efficiently kept at an adequate level through reputation standards instituted by insurance companies etc it also discusses how currency could be provided without government chapter property the great problem solver argues that most social problems could be solved through an increase in the amount and type of property owned it claims that taxation is theft and that regulation by initiated force is slavery it argues that it should be possible to claim ownership over the ocean floor the surface of other planets corridors of airspace radio wavelengths and so on by being the first to occupy them or otherwise clearly stake out territory it also argues that all public property should be privatized in order to reduce crime and pollution chapter arbitration of disputes argues that governmental arbiters are not necessary since man who agrees to the settlement of disputes by third party and then breaks the contract would suffer harm to his reputation and be ostracized thus solving the problem of noncompliance it notes that the government judges will tend to be biased in favor of government since that is the entity from which they receive their salaries and power it promotes the concept of insurance companies as substitute for government as the institution used to pursue claims in the event person were defrauded they could file claim with their insurance company and the insurer would obtain the right of subrogation insurers who themselves committed abuses would suffer loss of reputation and be at competitive disadvantage to more reputable insurers chapter protection of life and property asserts that person has the right to defend his life against aggression and that he therefore has the right to defend his possessions as well since they are the results of his investment of parts of his life and are thus extensions of that life it notes pacifism encourages every thug to continue his violent ways even though the pacifist may devoutly wish he wouldn wishes don create reality pacifistic behavior teaches the aggressor that crime does pay and encourages him to more and bigger aggressions such sanctioning of injustices is immoral and because it is immoral it is also impractical it argues that self defense is personal responsibility which one can fulfill by hiring an agent to protect him such as private defense agency it distinguishes initiated force from retaliatory force noting that the former is not market phenomenon because it acts to destroy the market but the latter is market phenomenon because it restrains aggressors who would destroy it and or exacts reparations from them it notes that government creates social environment which breeds crime through its prohibitions on gambling prostitution drugs and so on it argues that the main role of police is to protect the government rather than the citizens it contrasts the police with private defense agencies which would focus on preventing aggression and whose officers would lack immunity for any offenses they might commit it also notes that insurance companies might sell policies covering the insured against loss resulting from any type of coercion and that these insurers could bring unruly defense agencies to their knees through ostracism and boycotts yet at the same time the insurers would seek to avoid taking such action without cause since it could be costly and result in boycotts against the insurer itself chapter dealing with coercion argues that punishment in the form of eye for an eye vengeance does nothing to compensate the victim and therefore opposes justice it argues that an aggressor should repay the victim for his loss and for all expenses occasioned by the aggression such as the cost of apprehending the offender it further states that when an offender could not pay the restitution for crime in his lifetime the additional expenses could be paid by the insurance company chapter rectification of injustice notes that some criminals of particularly untrustworthy nature might need to work off their debt in workhouses to insure against refusal to work the reparations payments would be deducted from each pay before room and board costs and those who refused to work would not eat or would have only minimal diet variety of degrees of confinement would exist the argument that the rich would buy crime is refuted by the argument that even wealthy man could be killed in self defense if he attempted violent act and that he would risk his reputation as well chapter warring defense agencies and organized crime asserts the falsity of the assumption that government is necessary to prevent the initiation of force by arguing that government as coercive monopoly must initiate force in order to survive it notes several factors that would make private defense agency avoid aggression it would put itself at risk of retaliation and would lead its customers to fear that in the event of falling out it would turn its aggressive force against them moreover insurers would consider the company to be poor risk its employees would also be liable for any damages they caused which would cause problems between the companies and its employees if it ordered unjustified attacks it also speculates that mafia style agency would be unlikely to survive since there would be no black market to support it the chapter argues that tyrant would have more difficulty rising to power under system of competing private defense agencies than under governmental system because customers oppressed by their company could simply switch to another company and obtain protection from the tyrant chapter legislation and objective law argues that free men acting in free market would manage their affairs in accordance with natural law it calls statutory law clumsy anachronistic and unjust hindrance it also argues that government judges have no market signals to guide their decisions in contrast to free market arbiters who have profit and loss as built in correction mechanism chapter foreign aggression notes that governments obtain the resources used for defense from the people and those same resources can be used by private defense agencies to protect the people from aggression it argues that governments aggravate or threaten other governments to the point of armed conflict and then coerce their citizens into protecting them it notes that the ability of aggression insurers to pay claims would be enhanced by the limited damage resulting from the fact that foreign aggressors would need to use conventional warfare in wars of conquest to avoid destroying the property and slaves they seek to gain it notes that in laissez faire society there would be no government that could surrender to the enemy defenders would fight as long as they perceived it was in their best interest chapter the abolition of war argues that government not business is responsible for the formation of the military industrial complex it notes that the burden of supporting wars falls heavily on business since taxes are taken out of the pocket of the consumer moreover businesses are society producers and it is society producers who pay the bills business also suffers from wars because of the disruption of trade and the ruin and poverty that result government however gains from wars because it is left with more power more money and more territory war also helps unite the people behind the government in the face of common enemy the authors conclude that all that is needed to abolish war is to abolish government part iii how do we get there chapter from government to laissez faire argues that first and foremost the economy should be provided with media of exchange to replace the dollar it states that possession of public property should be taken by individuals who simply by clearly marking their claims become the rightful owners it argues against disposing of public property at auction since bureaucrats would figure out ways to divert the proceeds into their own pockets and the system would be biased toward the rich many of whom obtained their wealth through political pull the process of auctioning off the property would also prolong the politicians power chapter the force which shapes the world argues that it is immoral to destroy the private property or life of an individual who has not aggressed against one it argues that violent revolution is not only destructive but actually strengthens the government it also notes that revolution leaders could then become the next rulers because of the people desire for leader to get them out of chaos the chapter opines that violent revolution would pave the way for new hitler this chapter calls for people to share ideas related to freedom which can eventually lead to widespread non cooperation with government references external

publications on subjectivity braidotti publications have consistently been placed in continental philosophy at the intersection with social and political theory cultural politics gender feminist theory and ethnicity studies the core of her work consists of four interconnected monographs on the constitution of contemporary subjectivity with special emphasis on the concept of difference within the history of european philosophy and political theory braidotti philosophical project investigates how to think difference positively which means moving beyond the dialectics that both opposes it and thus links it by negation to the notion of sameness this is evidenced in the philosophical agenda set in her first book patterns of dissonance an essay on women in contemporary french philosophy which gets developed further in the trilogy that follows in the next book nomadic subjects embodiment and difference in contemporary feminist theory the question is formulated in more concrete terms can gender ethnic cultural or european differences be understood outside the straitjacket of hierarchy and binary opposition thus the following volume metamorphoses towards materialist theory of becoming analyses not only gender differences but also more categorical binary distinctions between self and other european and foreign human and non human animal environmental technological others the conclusion is that systematic ambivalence structures contemporary cultural representations of the globalised technologically mediated ethnically mixed gender aware world we now inhabit the question consequently arises of what it takes to produce adequate cultural and political representations of fast changing world and move closer to spinozian notions of adequate understanding the ethical dimension of braidotti work on difference comes to the fore in the last volume of the trilogy transpositions on nomadic ethics here she surveys the different ethical approaches that can be produced by taking difference and diversity as the main point of reference and conclude that there is much to be gained by suspending belief that political participation moral empathy and social cohesion can only be produced on the basis of the notion of recognition of sameness braidotti makes case for an alternative view on subjectivity ethics and emancipation and pitches diversity against the postmodernist risk of cultural relativism while also standing against the tenets of liberal individualism throughout her work braidotti asserts and demonstrates the importance of combining theoretical concerns with serious commitment to producing socially and politically relevant scholarship that contributes to making difference in the world braidotti output also included several edited volumes her work has been translated in total of languages and all the main books in at least three languages other than english latest publications her most recent book is the posthuman polity press the posthuman offers both an introduction and major contribution to contemporary debates on the posthuman as the traditional distinction between the human and its others has blurred exposing the non naturalistic structure of the human the posthuman starts by exploring the extent to which post humanist move displaces the traditional humanistic unity of the subject rather than perceiving this situation as loss of cognitive and moral self mastery braidotti argues that the posthuman helps us make sense of our flexible and multiple identities braidotti then analyzes the escalating effects of post anthropocentric thought which encompass not only other species but also the sustainability of our planet as whole because contemporary market economies profit from the control and commodification of all that lives they result in hybridization erasing categorical distinctions between the human and other species seeds plants animals and bacteria these dislocations induced by globalized cultures and economies enable critique of but how reliable are they as indicators of sustainable future the posthuman concludes by considering the implications of these shifts for the institutional practice of the humanities braidotti outlines new forms of cosmopolitan neo humanism that emerge from the spectrum of post colonial and race studies as well as gender analysis and the challenge of the posthuman condition consists in seizing the opportunities for new social bonding and community building while pursuing sustainability and empowerment in braidotti published two new books the renewed and revised

police for spray painting graffiti on new york city subway wall at the first avenue station his treatment while in police custody and the ensuing trials of the arresting officers all of whom were acquitted sparked debate concerning police brutality and the of arresting officials in handling suspects this was widely publicized episode in new york city history of police brutality cases word of the arrest came out on september as the committee against racially motivated police violence was holding news conference to publicize united states congress hearing into complaints of police abuse stewart had been arrested earlier that day he died at age on september after days in coma the cause of death was listed as cardiac arrest arrest and death first avenue station pictured when he was arrested alt the first avenue subway station at on september graffiti artist michael stewart was arrested for spraying graffiti at the first avenue station on the brooklyn bound platform transit police officer john kostick found stewart scrawling rqs on the wall and had him arrested stewart allegedly said hey man you got me kostick cuffed stewart and walked him to the turnstile to be identified as stewart was still living with his parents he asked the police not to call his home to wake them up officer kostick claimed stewart was initially cordial but suddenly ran off and had to be restrained while waiting for the arrest transport van at the top of the stairs stewart fell face forward on the ground said kostick the officer held stewart to the ground until the van arrived where several officers put him inside stewart was taken to the district transit police station at th street union square two stops away while being taken to the station kostick said stewart became very violent in the van stewart struggled with the officers and ran to the street he was beaten unconscious he was hogtied bound at the ankles and tethered hands to feet by an elastic strap during the struggle stewart wails could be heard by parsons school of design students from their dorm windows parsons student rebecca reiss heard stewart say oh my god someone help me and what did do what did do he was booked at the union square district transit police headquarters for resisting arrest and unlawful possession of marijuana the transit police supervisors deemed stewart emotionally disturbed stewart was placed back into the van and transported to bellevue hospital to undergo psychiatric observation stewart arrived at bellevue at he was handcuffed his legs was bound and he was comatose with blood alcohol content of more than double the threshold needed to arrest someone for drunk driving stewart was dating suzanne mallouk at the time she went with stewart family to see him at the hospital according to their account he had bruises and cuts on his body the doctors confirmed he was brain dead and had hemorrhaged in way that suggested he had either been choked or strangled stewart died on september thirteen days after his arrest aftermath postmortem examination in charge of determining stewart cause of death was the city medical examiner dr elliot gross gross had three separate findings he first declared stewart had died due to excessive drinking alcohol poisoning which led to the coma and subsequent heart attack thus the police were not at fault stewart family and advocates were unconvinced and believed this was classic cover up in second autopsy conducted month later gross declared that stewart had died from spinal cord injury in the upper neck in his third assessment he said that stewart died from blunt force trauma according to the new york times gross declined to specify what caused the injury explaining only that there are number of possibilities as to how an injury of these type can occur he refused to talk to press unless testifying before the grand jury gross said stewart injuries including the facial bruising and the abrasions on his wrists sustained during his arrest were not said to contribute to his death nurses said his hands and face were blue when he arrived at the hospital and that it took minutes to remove the cuffs they also said that he had been beaten brutally stewart family doctors contradict what was in the final autopsy report done by gross doctors hired by stewart family to perform secondary autopsy found his cause of death to be strangulation dr gross said there were no evidence of strangulation critical information such as stewart eyes were removed and held by gross and were not allowed to be studied by the doctors hired by stewart family his eyes were crucial because they would have shown evidence of hemorrhaging due to lack of oxygen from being strangled gross incompetence led the stewart family to call for petition to remove him as chief medical examiner claiming alleged wrongdoing and the medical examiners office cannot be trusted with the safekeeping of items following the trial all six policemen were acquitted of criminal charges dr gross was later fired and stewart parents were compensated million for their child death stewart death would be remembered as an egregious tragedy of police abuse grand jury investigation and trials grand jury investigation was initiated in october to determine what happened to stewart in the minutes between being arrested and his delivery to the hospital on october about twenty black community leaders including city councilwoman mary pinkett protested outside the manhattan district attorney robert morgenthau office at the criminal court building morgenthau refused to see the group stating that it would be inappropriate to comment before the case went to the grand jury in november the medical examiner final report issued on november differed from his preliminary report gross declined to state explicitly what caused the death but reported that stewart died of physical injury to the spinal cord in the upper neck and concluded that there were number of possibilities as to how an injury of this type can occur during the five month trial in the new york supreme court some witnesses testified that stewart was struck and kicked by officers while other witnesses said they did not see officers beat stewart none were able to determine who was responsible for handling stewart and none were able to identify which officers took which actions at the arrest experts could not agree on what combination of injuries intoxication and cardiac health issues ended stewart life seven months into the grand jury investigation the case was dismissed because juror ronald fields initiated private investigations on the case in february second grand jury introduced the case before justice george roberts which indicted three officers john kostick anthony piscola and henry boerner with criminally negligent homicide assault and perjury three other officers sgt henry hassler sgt james barry and susan techky who denied that they saw officers kick stewart were charged with perjury in june jury selection began in state supreme court in manhattan for the trial prosecutor morgenthau went to the second trial with two theories one of neck injury leading to the death and the other that beatings caused cardiac arrest prosecutors pushed for second degree manslaughter to be charged if it was determined the officers recklessly caused the death the jury was instructed that to support charge of criminally negligent homicide they had to find that the officers failed to take reasonable steps to prevent death the prosecution hoped to establish law requiring officers to have an affirmative duty to protect prisoners in their custody from abuse william mckechnie of the transit patrolman benevolent association denied the officers role in the death stating if someone dies of heart attack we are not doctors the new york civil liberties union believed the second set of indictments signaled new direction in how prosecutors treat police abuse cases richard emery lawyer for the new york city liberties union stated the theory underlining this case is perhaps the most important development in stemming the tide of police abuse it makes police officers strictly responsible for their prisoners it holds them accountable on november the six officers were acquitted by an all white jury in the officers and the mta were charged with million civil suit filed by the stewart family which prompted hundreds of off duty transit police officers to march along madison avenue in front of the mta headquarters carrying signs reading end the witch hunt and when are we finally innocent in august stewart parents and his siblings john and lisha cole stewart settled the civil suit out of court for million as of the police and city officials stated they were not to blame for the death of michael stewart reactions family stewart family called death an act of racism and brutality attorneys representing the stewart family described michael as retiring and almost docile pound young artist and pratt institute student who was on his way home to his clinton hill brooklyn neighborhood where he lived with his mother carrie and father millard who was retired metropolitan transit authority maintenance worker they maintained that the white officers had beaten black artist and model it stirred public protests by black activists and others believing that city officials are covering up for the transit police mta in march the mta determined that only one officer john kostick was subject to suspension based on departmental charges of perjury the mta board approved additional training for transit officers in the handling of emotionally disturbed people and changed its policies on how the department internal affairs unit becomes involved with cases of possible misconduct tributes artists paid homage to stewart including the death of radio raheem in spike lee film do the right thing and in the song graffiti limbo penned by

western world as well as japan korea and south america history crystal palace the stimulus to create mandolin groups often came from travelling mandolinists and teachers immigration from europe to other parts of the world resulted in the concept spreading rapidly with movements beginning quite early in the usa japan and australia some indication of the speed of these developments across the

underestimated tulane mandolin club in new orleans considerable body of music was created much of which was simple or popular marches and foxtrots that were easy and fun to play however some serious music was also created and which requires every bit as much skill to play as anything in the more well known violin repertoire principal among the important composers of such music were raffaele

as well as full orchestras after world war the mandolin orchestras went into period of decline until interest in the mandolin was renewed as part of the resurgent interest in folk music in the late

naturalized american citizen together they were the subjects of the first terrorism trial in the state of california both were alleged to be part of or associated with terrorist sleeper cell terrorism charges and trial in june hamid hayat was arrested and charged with providing material support to terrorists and of lying about it to fbi agents the prosecution alleged that hamid hayat had spent the better part of two years at an al qaeda training camp in pakistan returning in with an intent to attack civilian targets in the united states the defense contended that hayat was in pakistan to engage an arranged marriage on april jury voted to convict hamid hayat of one count of providing material support or resources to terrorists and three counts of making false statements to the fbi in matters related to international or domestic terrorism the maximum penalty for these charges is years of imprisonment sentencing was set for july before district judge garland burrell jr his father umer hayat was also arrested and charged with two counts of making false statements to the fbi regarding the investigation of his son and of certain members of the muslim community of lodi umer charges ended in hung jury when faced with retrial for the same offenses he pled guilty in exchange for release with time served debate the younger hayat conviction is controversial in some circles supporters of the hayats believe them to be innocents railroaded by overzealous fbi agents and post islamophobia they cite the occasionally outlandish nature of the confessions especially umer in particular where he describes supposed al qaeda training camp populated by thousand men doing pole vault practice in ninja masks teenage mutant ninja turtle masks according to the los angeles times hamid hayat attorney wazhma mojaddidi also claims that he had been worn down by the fbi five hour interrogation and confessed to crimes he did not commit hamid and umer hayat separate videotaped confessions were the linchpin of the government case former fbi agent james wedick jr veteran of years believed the confessions had been coaxed with intimidation and leading questions wedick was never allowed to testify and present his analysis of the confession videotapes at hamid hayat original trial prior to being contacted by defense attorneys for hamid hayat wedick had had no knowledge of or involvement with the case the government argued that there is greater pattern at work government informant taped him saying in regard to the murder of daniel pearl by pakistani terrorists they killed him so pleased about that they cut him into pieces and sent him back that was good job they did now they can send one jewish person to pakistan fbi agents also recovered from his room jihadist magazines of the jaish mohammed and jihad scrapbook containing articles praising the taliban and osama bin laden hamid also carried in his wallet supposed jihadi supplication reading allah we place you at their throats and we seek refuge in you from their evils much was made of how umer hayat seemed to possess sums of cash unusual for an ice cream truck driver with only an th grade education home with no outstanding debt according to district court judge garland burrell hayat appears to have access to significant amount of cash from an unexplained source there is also tenuous family connection to radical islam umer father in law hamid maternal grandfather is prominent leader in the jamiat ulema islam conservative strictly religious political party in pakistan strongly associated with the taliban in afghanistan previously on april father and son had been stopped at dulles international airport on the way to pakistan they were attempting to illegally carry in cash out of the country according to the defense this was money they had saved to build vacation home in pakistan and to pay for hamid wedding and the wedding of his sister motion for new trial after his initial conviction hamid hayat sought new trial for which his attorneys wazhma mojaddidi and dennis riordan filed motion on the grounds of misconduct by jury foreman joseph cote as well as other court misconduct cote allegedly used racial slurs during the trial and compared hayat to the pakistani men who had conducted the recent terrorist attacks in london see july london bombings and july london bombings cote also contacted an excused alternative juror during deliberations the hearing was held on april on may district judge garland burrell jr rejected new trial for hamid hayat writing in his ruling that the reports of juror misconduct were not credible hamid hayat defense attorney wazhma mojaddidi announced plans to appeal september sentencing on september hamid hayat was sentenced to years in federal prison it was his th birthday in the words of federal judge garland burrell jr hayat had re entered the ready and willing to wage violent jihad pre crime the hamid hayat case is seen as an example of pre crime conviction mcculloch and wilson the dissenting judge tashima in hayat unsuccessful appeal argued he would reverse the conviction because the judicial branch constitutional duty to do justice in criminal prosecutions was not fulfilled in this case in which the government asked jury to deprive man of his liberty largely based on dire but vague predictions that the defendant might commit unspecified crimes in the future united states hayat emphasis in original judge tashima acknowledged that the law permitted conviction on the basis that the defendant might commit such unspecified crimes in the future but argued that when the law allows for such convictions every aspect of the trial should be scrupulously fair and that hayat trial did not meet this standard the majority likewise described the government preventative approach as one that permits the conviction of potential terrorists who may never in fact have committed any terrorist act if not arrested and convicted

      "the west virginia coal wars also known as the mine wars arose out of dispute between coal companies and miners the first workers strike in west virginia was the cabin creek and paint creek strike of with help from mary mother jones an important figure in unionizing the mine workers the miners demanded better pay better work conditions the right to trade where they pleased ending the practice of forcing miners to buy from company owned stores and recognition of the united mine workers umw the mining companies however refused to meet the demands of the workers and instead hired baldwin felts agents equipped with high powered rifles to guard the mines and act as strikebreakers after the agents arrived the miners either moved out or were evicted from the houses they had been renting from the coal companies moving into coal camps that were being supported by the union approximately people lived in these coal camps month after the strike began hostilities began with the arrival of the baldwin felts agents who provoked the miners socialist party activists began supplying miners with weapons machine guns high powered rifles and rounds of ammunition on september approximately unionized miners from across the kanawha river crossed the river and declared their intent to kill the mine guards and destroy the company operations due to this threat the mining companies deployed additional armed guards and awaited the miners attack consequently the governor proclaimed martial law to be in effect on september seizing high powered rifles pistols machine guns rounds of ammunition and blackjacks as well as large quantities of daggers bayonets and brass knuckles on may shootout in matewan west virginia between agents of the baldwin felts and local miners who later joined the united mine workers of america sparked what became known as the battle of blair mountain the largest insurrection in the united states since the american civil war background coal mining in west virginia west virginia had only few active coal mines during the us civil war with less than miners in the whole state coal mining would flourish however between and after competing railroad companies began carving routes through the mountains of appalachia west virginia produced tons of coal in tons of coal in and tons of coal in the quick expansion of mining in west virginia prompted many mining companies to construct company towns in which mining companies own many if not all housing amenities and public services miners were often paid in coal scrip paper notes issued by mining companies that could only be redeemed at company owned stores in company towns mining is dangerous profession overall but between and west virginia mines had the highest miner death rates in the country during world war west virginia miners faced higher deathrates than even soldiers in the american expeditionary force fighting in europe mining unions in west virginia some west virginian

unionized in march paint creek umw miners attempted to renegotiate their contracts for higher pay and automatic union dues in response number of paint creek mines withdrew their recognition of uwm on april union and non union miners from paint creek as well as miners from the previously non union cabin creek kanawha and fayette counties went on strike the umw set up tent camps for miners and their families who had often been evicted without warning umw vice president frank hayes and the well known labor activist mary mother jones even visited the state to pledge their support mining companies in the paint creek area hired strikebreakers and armed guards to suppress the strike including agents from the baldwin felts detective agency striking miners and their families were prohibited from using company bridges and roads as well as utilities like running water company guards killed several miners over the first few months of the strike and constructed machine gun equipped armored train known as the bull moose special which they used to fire upon the tent camps of striking workers miners with the support of mother jones and the socialist party of america acquired weapons and retaliated against the mining company guards in september west virginia governor william glasscock declared martial law and sent state troops to confiscate weapons and ammunition attempted to quell the rising tensions between miners and mining companies while the declaration of martial law did reduce armed conflict in the winter of in april umw officials presented the paint creek mining companies with compromise deal leaving out some miner demands but maintaining support for hour workday accountability for miner compensation and protection from backlash for union membership after nearly full year of work stoppages and fighting the mining companies accepted the umw compromise which was enforced by west virginia state soldiers the battle of matewan on april and between and

miners would peacefully comply miners in mingo county continued to join the umwa may united mine workers meeting drew attendees by may the umwa set up tent colony for evicted miners outside of matewan on may thirteen agents of the baldwin felts detective agency returned to matewan to evict miners from stone mountain coal corporation housing the baldwin felts agents were challenged by matewan police chief sid hatfield and matewan mayor cabel testerman who contested the agents authority in the town the baldwin felts agents persisted however based on permission from local justice of the peace baldwin felts agents carried out their evictions under watch of crowd of miners and their families hearing of the trouble stirring in matawen miners from surrounding areas armed themselves and made their way to the town in case of larger conflict as the baldwin felts agents were headed to the train station to depart matewan they were confronted once more by police chief sid hatfield mayor cabel testerman both hatfield and baldwin felts agent albert felts reported that they had warrants for the others arrest accounts of the may th shootout itself differ some reports indicate that baldwin felts agents attempted to arrest sid hatfield and shot mayor testermen when he intervened on hatfield behalf other indicate that hatfield initiated the violence either by firing himself or by signalling prepared ambush in either case the shootout resulted in dead mayor testerman miners and baldwin felts agents including baldwin felts agency chief thomas felts younger brothers albert and

hatfield and fifteen other men alleged to have participated in the matewan shootout specifically on the charge of murdering albert felts all sixteen men were however acquitted by mingo county jury shortly thereafter the west virginia state legislature passed bill allowing criminal cases to be prosecuted with juries summoned from another county murder charges were renewed only this time for the

wallabout market in brooklyn designed by william tubby in dutch colonial style in the modern use of the term is to indicate broad gambrel roof with flaring eaves that extend over the long sides resembling barn in construction the early houses built by settlers were often single room with additions added to either end or short side and very often porch along both long sides typically walls were made of stone and chimney was located on one or both ends common were double hung sash windows with outward swinging wood shutters and central double dutch door settlers of the dutch colonies in new york delaware new jersey and western connecticut built these homes in ways familiar to the regions of europe from which they came like the low countries the palatine parts of germany and huguenot regions of france used for its modern meaning of gambrel roofed house the term does not reflect the fact that housing styles in dutch founded communities in new york evolved over time in the hudson valley for example the use of brick or brick and stone is perhaps more characteristic of dutch colonial houses than is their use of gambrel roof in albany and ulster counties frame houses were almost unknown before while in dutchess and westchester counties the presence of greater proportion of settlers with english roots popularised more construction of wood frame houses after period of log cabin and bank dugout construction the use of the inverted roof shape was common the gambrel roof was used later predominantly between and although examples can be found from as early as the general rule before was to build houses that were only one and half stories high except in albany where there were greater proportion of two story houses fine examples of these houses can be found today like those

      "rhizopogon is genus of ectomycorrhizal basidiomycetes in the family rhizopogonaceae species form hypogeous sporocarps commonly referred to as false truffles the general morphological characters of rhizopogon sporocarps are simplex or duplex peridium surrounding loculate gleba that lacks columnella basidiospores are produced upon basidia that are borne within the fungal hymenium that coats the interior surface of gleba locules the peridium is often adorned with thick mycelial cords also known as rhizomorphs that attach the sporocarp to the surrounding substrate the scientific name rhizopogon is greek for root rhiz beard pogon and this name was given in reference to the rhizomorphs found on sporocarps of many species rhizopogon species are primarily found in ectomycorrhizal association with trees in the family pinaceae and are especially common symbionts of pine fir and douglas fir trees through their ectomycorrhizal relationships rhizopogon are thought to play an important role in the ecology of coniferous forests recent and molecular phylogenetic study has established that rhizopogon is member of the boletales closely related to suillus taxonomy and diversity sporocarp of rhizopogon luteolus obtextus showing rhizomorphs with adhering substrate historical classification the genus rhizopogon occurs throughout the natural and introduced ranges of family pinaceae trees though this range covers much of the northern temperate zones the diversity of rhizopogon species is well characterized only in north america and europe there are currently over recognized species of rhizopogon the morphology of rhizopogon species is highly cryptic and characters vary greatly throughout sporocarp maturity this has led to the description of multiple species from various developmental stages of single fungus the genus rhizopogon was first described from europe by elias magnus fries in the north american monograph was produced by alexander smith in with second author credits given posthumously to sanford myron zeller due to his contributions to the study of the genus european monograph of rhizopogon has also been published in the recent past molecular phylogenetic methods have allowed the revision of the taxonomic concepts of the genus rhizopogon modern classification modern taxonomic concepts of the genus rhizopogon recognize five subgenera of rhizopogon these are subgenus rhizopogon subgenus versicolores subgenus villosuli subgenus amylopogon and subgenus roseoli ecology sporocarp of rhizopogon roseolus in cross section showing close up of the gleba locules mammalian diet and spore dispersal rhizopogon species have been established as common component in the diet of many small mammals as well as deer in western north america the viability of rhizopogon spores is maintained and may even be increased after mammalian gut passage making mammals an important dispersal vector for rhizopogon disturbance ecology rhizopogon species are common members of the fungal communities that colonize the roots of trees during seedling establishment and persist into old growth stands rhizopogon spores are long lived in soil and the spores of some species can persist for at least four years with an increase in viability over time rhizopogon seems to be especially common upon the roots of establishing tree seedlings following disturbance such as fire or logging rhizopogon are also abundant colonizers of pot cultivated and field cultivated conifer seedlings growing in soil from conifer stands that lacked observations of rhizopogon upon the roots of mature trees these finding suggest that rhizopogon species are an important factor in the recovery of conifer forests following disturbance species rhizopogon albidus rhizopogon ater rhizopogon amylopogon rhizopogon atroviolaceus rhizopogon brunneniger rhizopogon ellenae rhizopogon evadens rhizopogon fulvigleba rhizopogon fuscorubens rhizopogon

truncatus rhizopogon vesiculosus rhizopogon villosulus rhizopogon vinicolor rhizopogon vulgaris ethnomycology forestry the first intentional use of rhizopogon species in forestry occurred in the early part of the th century when rhizopogon luteolus was deliberately introduced into pinus radiata plantations in western australia after it was observed to improve tree growth since that time rhizopogon species have been widely studied as component of managed forests rhizopogon species have been noted as common members of the ectomycorrhizal community colonizing tree roots of pine and douglas fir timber plantations naturally occurring rhizopogon roseolus rubescens spores have been shown to out compete the spores of other ectomycorrhizal fungi in pine plantations even when competing spores were directly inoculated onto seedlings the survival rate and performance of pine and douglas fir plantation seedlings are increased after inoculation with rhizopogon species gastronomy though many species of rhizopogon are considered edible most are not held in high culinary esteem notable exception is rhizopogon roseolus rubescens which is considered delicacy in east asia and especially in japan where it is traditionally known as shoro techniques for the commercial cultivation of this fungus in pine plantations have been developed and applied with successful results in japan and new zealand

      "xestia is genus of noctuid moths family noctuidae they are the type genus of the tribe xestiini in subfamily noctuinae though some authors merge this tribe with the noctuini species in this genus are commonly known as clays darts or rustics but such names are commonplace among noctuidae xestia moths have wide distribution though they most prominently occur in the holarctic with almost species included at one time xestia was something of wastebin genus but almost half of the traditional species are now placed elsewhere see below and some of the remaining ones are liable to be assigned to another genus also on the other hand new moths that probably do belong in this genus are still being discovered hypographa which led to the transfer of ornata from eugraphe to here thus unless there are drastic taxonomic changes in the future xestia is likely to remain one of the larger noctuine genera ecology xestia adults are usually of medium size and robust build with stout hairy bodies and strong wings some are quite colorful with bold lighter markings and hindwings in delicate yellowish reddish or bluish hues generally they are cryptic while at rest however with unmarked pale or dull brownish hindwings they do not have metallic hues and few species possess obvious eyespots caterpillar of the double square spot triangulum this genus includes many species living at high latitudes and altitudes in tundra and taiga ecosystems some have two year semivoltine life cycles and only occur as adults every other year typically the caterpillar larva overwinters to pupate in spring with the moths flying around midsummer but some species eclose later their moths flying from late summer into autumn xestia caterpillars are generally stout and cryptically colored in some species they have quite prominent dark lengthwise spots but may be entirely green or whatever else gives best camouflage some species larvae are notoriously polyphagous the setaceous hebrew character nigrum the food of which includes all sorts of core eudicots including solanaceae and others which are poisonous to many herbivores as well as some monocots the latter are mainly poaceae however and few other monocots are utilized by xestia larvae in general ericaceae as well as betulaceae and poaceae are key food plants for many of the high latitude species gymnosperms are food plants of secondary importance in this genus but pinaceae form the mainstay or exclusive food of some species which occasionally become more than nuisance pests altogether xestia moths are only known as major pests within limited areas or in regard to specific plants in which cases damage can be economically significant though even though the larval food plants of many xestia species are not or insufficiently known those on record are from all major lineages of core eudicots among the basal core eudicots caryophyllales especially polygonaceae are particularly significant of the asterids the asterales especially asteraceae ericales especially ericaceae and lamiales especially plantaginaceae and of the rosids the malpighiales numerous families and rosales especially rosaceae less important asterid orders among xestia food plants are for example dipsacales gentianales and solanales of the rosids fabales fagales malvales myrtales and sapindales more basal mes angiosperms do not seem to be significant as xestia food plants at least not in temperate and cooler regions as far as is known xestia adults are nocturnal or crepuscular except of course the high latitude species but are often attracted to lights at night they general feed on flowers with relatively short or no corolla and will also drink other sugary liquids systematics and taxonomy several species formerly placed here are now in agnorisma and whether other genera are accepted varies among authors estimata hemigraphiphora and perinaenia are provisionally considered distinct here xestia versuta does not seem to belong in the present genus it may be an aberrant member of goniographa but until this is resolved it is here treated under its original name eugraphe versuta furthermore case for separation has in particular been made for amathes possibly including agrotiphila lytaea megasema possibly including megarhomba segetia and schoyenia with archanarta occasionally also separate but these are here included in xestia some of them are however recognized as subgenera and if the genus is split further would be first to become elevated in rank again there is no real good justification for either treatment except that the lengthy process of thorough revision of noctuine systematics and taxonomy has only progressed so far beck in published comprehensive taxonomic catalogue introducing generic names for most european groups of presumably related species while few of these seem to stand any chance ever to be widely recognized as distinct genera this step is likely to have made available generic name

      "the brothers grimm are two sets of fictional twin supervillains appearing in american comic books published by marvel comics publication history the first appearance of the first brothers grimm came in spider woman these were pair of identical magically animated mannequins created by doll collector nathan dolly also known as mister doll and his wife priscilla during their initial appearances only one was ever seen at time and the singular identity brother grimm was used instead of their true plural name after three return appearances in spider woman they perished in issue though the characters were introduced while marv wolfman was writing spider woman their origin and identities were not revealed until mark gruenwald run on the series questioned as to whether he had told gruenwald the characters origin or gruenwald had come up with it himself wolfman admitted that he could not even remember if the origin he had originally envisioned for the characters was the same as the one ultimately used by gruenwald except that brother grimm actually being two people was his intention from the beginning though wolfman could not remember how the brothers grimm were created he has said he is confident that their visual design must have come from series penciler carmine infantino usually gave the artist concept of what wanted and then let them have field day with it carmine created brilliant designs in the flash so would certainly have bowed to his expertise the second brothers grimm appeared in iron man they would eventually be thrown together with other lesser known super villains in group called the night shift fictional character biography first pair mister doll was criminal who could mystically harm person by harming doll whose features he could reshape to resemble the victim later in the process of creating the brothers grimm dolls nathan consciousness was trapped simultaneously inside both doll mannequins these mannequins mailed themselves to nathan wife priscilla and transferred their life forces into two life size versions she named them jake and william after the historical brothers grimm and believed them to be her sons delusion which they played along with the brothers had sharply opposed personalities rarely could come to agreement and as such pursued separate criminal careers william though timid and shy in his civilian personality was flamboyant confrontational jokester in his brother grimm guise after debuting with robbery of theatre he pursued the more lucrative pursuit of stealing from diamond merchants in contrast jake was flirtatious in his civilian identity but cold and dispassionate as brother grimm preferring less publicly visible crimes such as extortion he was also less skilled with his abilities than william while william was able to consistently defeat spider woman jake was defeated in both his confrontations with her and william had to free him from prison william was later hired by pyrotechnics to capture spider woman and succeeded priscilla planned to use her occult knowledge to transfer nathan mind from the mannequins to living human body to this end jake abducted jerry hunt to use for the body and william captured spider woman to coerce magnus the sorcerer to perform the transfer spider woman pulled hunt out of the spell at the last moment and nathan consciousness dispersed second pair twin brothers percy and barton grimes are born in fresno california they work as realtors and while exploring theatre they own they find the original brothers grimm mannequins on whim they decide to

population mancuso was initially jailed in maximum security prison in itagüí antioquia after peace process that led to his demobilization and then transferred to prison in the city of cúcuta to help establish the whereabouts of some of the victims in surprise move by the colombian government mancuso along with other top members of the auc was extradited to the united states to stand trial on drug trafficking charges early years and education mancuso was born in montería the provincial capital of córdoba department in the northern colombian caribbean region his father was an italian immigrant from sapri and his mother montería native he is the second of six children he studied civil engineering in the pontificia universidad javeriana and later farming administration in the escuela de formación técnica agrícola in bogotá he also studied english at the university of pittsburgh in pennsylvania paramilitary leader he became prominent landowner in córdoba department and in he joined the autodefensas campesinas de córdoba urabá paramilitary group citing being tired of guerrilla extortion and abuses that the colombian authorities failed to prosecute the attacks by the guerrillas to the estate owners in the region brought as consequence the formation of illegally armed self defense groups to confront them this new movement had the sympathy of some sectors of the colombian government such as politicians and some security forces including then current and former members of the colombian national army the group was originally under the command of carlos castaño with mancuso as his main lieutenant the paramilitary groups in colombia later expanded and in april created what was known as autodefensas unidas de colombia auc an umbrella organization under the leadership of the autodefensas campesinas de córdoba urabá led by mancuso and castaño following the death of castaño mancuso became the strong man along with castaño brother vicente and consequently the main leader in the peace process with the colombian government of president álvaro uribe his name has been involved in the command of at least eight paramilitary groups that perpetrated several massacres such as mapiripán on september salvatore mancuso and juan carlos sierra ramirez were formally charged by the colombian and the american governments for the us government applied for his extradition to the united states in order to be judged by an american court marcuso was so unconcerned about it that he attended the ceremony of the bloque bananero demobilization following the peace process with the colombian state on november the extradition application was initially accepted by government of colombia but soon was suspended to complete the demobilization process of the auc mancuso demobilized officially and surrendered to the colombian authorities in the bloque catatumbo demobilization ceremony on december gonzo author matthew thompson describes his meeting with mancuso in montería in my colombian death on january mancuso admitted his crimes to colombian court following deal that his attorneys were pursuing to preclude his extradition to the united states for drug trafficking according to the country justice and peace law mancuso should reveal trafficking routes and drug contacts in order to completely fulfill the deal during his colombian imprisonment mancuso had his own website and criticized the colombian government led by álvaro uribe vélez on numerous occasions many politicians members of the national army and government officials he claimed had links with the auc extradition to the united states in the early morning of may mancuso and thirteen other paramilitary leaders were taken from their jail cells in surprise action by the colombian government according to colombian interior minister carlos holguín they had been refusing to comply to the country peace and justice law and were therefore extradited to the united states during his first appearance before the district of columbia court mancuso refused to speak after having said his name his lawyer pleaded not guilty for him the national movement of state crimes coalition of several victim organizations that have suffered from state or paramilitary violence has asked to return the paramilitary chiefs to the colombian authorities so they may be processed by the ordinary justice system and not under the framework of the law of justice and peace since this framework benefits the victimizers and not the victims since they have not told all of the truth have not made comprehensive reparations to the victims and have not dismantled their criminal structures the office of the united nations high commissioner for human rights in colombia stated that according to colombian law the reasons claimed by the president of the republic to proceed with the previously suspended extraditions are also grounds for their removal from the application of the law of justice and peace and for the loss of the benefits established therein the inter american commission stated that this affects the colombian state obligation to guarantee victims rights to truth justice and reparations for the crimes committed by the paramilitary groups the extradition impedes the investigation and prosecution of such grave crimes through the avenues established by the justice and peace law in colombia and through the colombian justice system regular criminal procedures it also closes the door to the possibility that victims can participate directly in the search for truth about crimes committed during the conflict and limits access to reparations for damages that were caused this action also interferes with efforts to determine links between agents of the state and these paramilitary leaders investigation by the new york times found that the extradited paramilitaries including mancuso had been given special treatment by the us justice system serving shorter sentences

starter dan haren and proceeded to steal second he scored on an rbi single by ken griffey jr to give the nl lead barry bonds nearly gave his hometown fans something to cheer for in the bottom of the third when with reyes on second he lofted high fly ball to left field but it was snared at the warning track by magglio ordóñez the al nearly tied the game in the fourth when alex rodriguez attempted to score on two out single by iván rodríguez however the throw to home plate by griffey allowed russell martin to tag rodriguez out at the plate to end the inning the al would score one inning later when after chris young issued leadoff walk to brian roberts ichiro suzuki hit long fly ball off the right field wall instead of caroming straight to griffey the ball took an unusual bounce off sign and ricocheted to griffey right this allowed ichiro to score on what is still the only inside the park home run in all star game history the homer gave the al lead and resulted in ichiro mvp win the lead would be augmented in the sixth when carl crawford hit line drive that just cleared the right field wall for home run though it appeared fan may have reached over the wall to catch it nl manager

the hole to brian roberts but he could not come up with it alfonso soriano followed with two run home run to right field to cut the nl deficit to one after putz walked hardy al manager jim leyland replaced him with francisco rodríguez however rodriguez had trouble consistently locating his pitches and walked derrek lee on check swing pitch and then orlando hudson to load the bases in move that

      "the persecution of serbs in the independent state of croatia included the extermination expulsion and forced religious conversion of large numbers of ethnic serbs by the genocidal policies of the ustashe regime in the independent state of croatia ndh during world war ii the ustashe regime systematically murdered approximately to serbs conservative estimates out of which up to died at the notorious jasenovac concentration camp according to current estimates background inter war period ethnic tensions between croats and serbs can be traced back to the great schism of during the time of the austrian empire many croats came to resent the privileges granted to serbs living in the croatian military frontier following the collapse of austria hungary in the final days of world war the croat and slovene dominated state of slovenes croats and serbs was established having fought on the side of the central powers during the war ethnic croats and slovenes who formed the majority of the state population were viewed unfavourably by western nations and as such they failed to gain recognition from the great powers this left them no choice but to join union largely dominated by ethnic serbs which came to be known as the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes upon its creation the state was composed of six million serbs million croats and million slovenes being the largest ethnic group the serbs favoured centralized state whereas croats slovenes and bosnian muslims did not approved on june and based on the serbian constitution of the so called vidovdan constitution established the kingdom of serbs croats and slovenes as parliamentary monarchy under the serbian karađorđević dynasty belgrade was chosen as the capital of the new state assuring serb and orthodox christian political dominance in croatian peasant party hss leader stjepan radić was assassinated on the floor of the country parliament by serbian nationalist the following year king alexander proclaimed the january dictatorship and renamed his country the kingdom of yugoslavia to deemphasize its ethnic makeup yugoslavia was divided into nine administrative units called banovinas six of which had ethnic serb majorities in the king issued decree which allowed the yugoslav parliament to reconvene on the condition that only pro yugoslav parties were allowed to be represented in it marginalized far right and far left movements thrived the ustaše croatian fascist party emerged as the most extreme movement of these the ustaše were driven by deep hatred of serbs and serbdom and claimed that croats and serbs were separated by an unbridgable cultural gulf which prevented them from ever living alongside each other they organized the so called velebit uprising in assaulting police station in the village of brušani in lika the police responded harshly to the assault and harassed the local population in the ustaše cooperated with bulgarian hungarian and italian right wing extremists to assassinate alexander while he visited the french city of marseille alexander cousin prince paul took the regency until alexander son peter ii turned eighteen ustaše leader ante pavelić believed that the assassination would cause yugoslavia to disintegrate instead countries that had assisted the organization such as italy and hungary cracked down on its members arrested them and destroyed their training camps at yugoslavia behest according to historian slavko goldstein the ustaše planned to commit genocide against ethnic serbs for years prior to the outbreak of world war ii one of pavelić main ideologues mijo babić wrote in croatian opposition to centralized yugoslavia continued following alexander assassination culminating with the signing of the cvetković maček agreement by croatian politician vladko maček and yugoslav prime minister dragiša cvetković on august by signing the agreement belgrade sought to accommodate moderate croats through the creation of largely autonomous banovina of croatia which covered percent of yugoslavia territory and included percent of its population it also ensured that maček became yugoslavia deputy premier ultimately the agreement was not successful it led to other yugoslav ethnic groups demanding status similar to that of croatia and failed to satisfy right wing croats such as those that had joined the ustaše who wanted fully independent croatian state the ustaše were enraged by the very notion of maček having negotiated with belgrade denouncing him as sell out right wing croats quickly orchestrated anti serbian incidents across the newly formed banovina and in june croatian national socialist party was established in zagreb on march yugoslavia bowed to german pressure and signed the tripartite pact in an effort to avoid war with the axis powers two days later group of serbian nationalist royal yugoslav air force officers organized coup état to depose prince paul and the government of dragiša cvetković peter was declared to be of age and was elevated to the throne upon hearing news of the coup adolf hitler immediately ordered the invasion of yugoslavia creation of the ndh occupation and partition of yugoslavia after the axis invasion in april the kingdom of yugoslavia was invaded by the axis powers and the puppet state known as the independent state of croatia ndh was created ruled by the ustaše regime the ideology of the ustaše movement was blend of nazism catholicism and croatian the ustaše supported the creation of greater croatia that would span to the drina river and the outskirts of belgrade the movement emphasized the need for racially pure croatia and promoted the extermination of serbs who were viewed as ethinic foreigners jews and gypsies major ideological influence on the croatian nationalism of the ustaše was the th century nationalist ante starčević starčević was an advocate of croatian unity and independence and was both anti habsburg and anti serb he envisioned the creation of greater croatia that would include territories inhabited by bosniaks serbs and slovenes considering bosniaks and serbs to be croats who had been converted to islam and eastern orthodox christianity and considering the slovenes to be mountain croats starčević argued that the large serb presence in the territories that were claimed by greater croatia was the result of recent settlement which had been encouraged by the habsburg rulers along with the influx of groups like vlachs who took up eastern orthodox christianity and identified themselves as serbs the ustaše used starčević theories to promote the annexation of bosnia and herzegovina to croatia and they recognized croatia as having two major ethnocultural components catholic croats and muslim croats because the ustaše saw the islam of the bosnian muslims as religion which keeps true the blood of croats armed struggle genocide and terrorism were glorified by the group independent state of croatia gathering of ustaše members in zagreb after nazi forces entered into zagreb on april pavelić closest associate slavko kvaternik proclaimed the formation of the independent state of croatia ndh on radio zagreb broadcast meanwhile pavelić and several hundred ustaše volunteers left their camps in italy and travelled to zagreb where pavelić declared new government on april he accorded himself the title of poglavnik the independent state of croatia was declared to be on croatian ethnic and historical territory the ndh combined most of modern croatia all of modern bosnia and herzegovina and parts of modern serbia into an italian german quasi protectorate ndh authorities led by the ustaše militia then implemented genocidal policies against the serb jewish and romani populations living in the new state the ustashe cruelty and sadism shocked even nazi commanders viktor gutić made several speeches in early summer calling serbs former enemies and unwanted elements to be cleansed and destroyed and also threatened croats who did not support their cause in the usage of the cyrillic script was banned and in june began the elimination of eastern serbian words from the croatian language as well as the shutting down of serbian schools ante pavelić ordered through the croatian state office for language the creation of new words from old roots some which are used today and purged many serbian words ustashe militias and death squads ustaše sawing off the head of serb civilian branko jungić in the summer of ustashe militias and death squads burnt villages and killed thousands of civilian serbs in the country side in sadistic ways with various weapons and tools men women children were hacked to death thrown alive into pits and down ravines or set on fire in churches some serb villages near srebrenica and ozren were wholly massacred while children were found impaled by stakes in villages between vlasenica and kladanj massacres large number of massacres were committed by the ustashe some of the more notable ones were gudovac massacre april serbs summary executed after arrest orders by kvaternik glina massacre may serbs herded into an orthodox church and shot after which it was set on fire glina massacres july august serbs willing to convert to catholicism in return for amnesty massacred at an orthodox church between other serbs later massacred in neighbouring villages by luburić forces concentration camps the train which carried prisoners to the jasenovac concentration camp the ustashe set up temporary concentration camps in the spring of and laid the groundwork for network of permanent camps in autumn the creation of concentration camps and extermination campaign of serbs had been planned by the ustashe leadership long before in ustashe state exhibits in zagreb the camps were portrayed as productive and peaceful work camps with photographs of smiling inmates croatia was the only axis satellite to have erected camps specifically for children serbs jews and romani were arrested and sent to concentration camps such as jasenovac stara gradiška gospić and jadovno there were camps in ndh in total special camps for children were those at sisak gornja rijeka and jastrebarsko while stara gradiška held thousands of children and women the largest and most notorious camp was the jasenovac stara gradiška complex the largest extermination camp in the balkans an estimated inmates perished there most serbs vjekoslav maks luburić the commander in chief of all the croatian camps announced the great efficiency of the jasenovac camp at ceremony on october and also boasted we have slaughtered here at jasenovac more people than the ottoman empire was able to do during its occupation of europe the srbosjek serb cutter an agricultural knife worn over the hand that was used by the ustaše for the quick slaughter of inmates bounded by rivers and two barbed wire fences making escape unlikely the jasenovac camp was divided into five camps the first two closed in december while the rest were active until the end of the war stara gradiška jasenovac held women and children the ciglana brickyards jasenovac iii camp the main killing ground and essentially death camp had mortality rate higher than auschwitz former brickyard furnace was engineered into crematorium with witness testimony of some including children being burnt alive and stench of human flesh spreading in the camp luburić had gas chamber built at jasenovac where considerable number of inmates were killed during three month experiment with sulfur dioxide and zyklon but this method was abandoned due to poor construction still that method was unnecessary as most inmates perished from starvation disease especially typhus assaults with mallets maces axes poison and knives the srbosjek serb cutter was glove with an attached curved blade designed to cut throats large groups of people were regularly executed upon arrival outside camps and thrown into the river unlike german run camps jasenovac specialized in brutal one on one violence such as guards attacking barracks with weapons and throwing the bodies in the trenches the infamous camp commander filipović dubbed fra sotona brother satan and the personification of evil on one occasion drowned serb women and children by flooding cellar filipović and other camp commanders such as dinko šakić and his wife the sister of maks luburić used ingenious torture there were throat cutting contests of serbs in which prison guards made bets among themselves as to who could slaughter the most inmates it was reported that guard and former franciscan priest petar brzica won contest on august after cutting the throats of inmates inmates were tied and hit over the head with mallets and half alive hung in groups by the granik ramp crane their intestines and necks slashed then dropped into the river when the partisans and allies closed in at the end of the war the ustashe began mass liquidations at jasenovac marching women and children to death and shooting most of the remaining male inmates then torched buildings and documents before fleeing religious persecution glina after which their throats were slit or heads bashed in as part of massacre campaign in the area the ustashe viewed religion and nationality as closely linked while roman catholicism and islam bosnian muslims were viewed as croats were recognized as croatian national religions eastern orthodoxy was deemed inherently incompatible with the croatian state project they saw orthodoxy as hostile because it was identified as serb on may law was passed on religious conversions pressuring serbs to convert to catholicism and thereby adopt croat identity this was made on the eve of pavelić meeting with pope pious xii in rome the catholic church in croatia headed by archbishop aloysius stepinac greeted it and adopted it into the church internal law the term serbian orthodox was banned in mid may as uncompatible with state order and substituted it with greek eastern faith by the end of september about half of the serbian orthodox clergy priests had been expelled ustashe propaganda legitimized persecution partly based on historical catholic orthodox struggle for domination in europe and catholic intolerance towards the schismatics following serb insurgency provoked by ustashe terror killing and deportation campaign the state directorate for regeneration launched program in the autumn of aimed at mass forced conversion of serbs already in the summer the ustashe had closed or destroyed most of the serbian orthodox churches and monasteries and deported imprisoned or murdered orthodox priests and bishops the conversions were meant to croatianize and permanently destroy the serbian orthodox church the vatican was not opposed to the forced conversions on february pope pious xii privately received ustashes in uniforms and blessed them giving symbolical support to their acts on february envoy to the holy see rusinović said that the holy see joyed over forced conversions cardinal luigi maglione the holy see secretary encouraged the croatian bishops in february letter to speed up the conversions and also stressed that the orthodox term be replaced with terms apostates or schismatics many fanatic catholic priests joined the ustashe blessed and supported their work and participated in killings and conversions in some or serbs were converted to roman catholicism although most temporarily converts would sometimes be killed anyway often in the same churches they were rebaptized of the serbian orthodox clergy was killed or expelled in lika kordun and banija alone serbian orthodox churches were closed destroyed or plundered on july the croatian orthodox church was founded in order to replace the institutions of the serbian orthodox church after the matter of forced conversion had become extremely controversial many catholic bishops and priests in croatia openly supported the ustashe actions and also there were no condemnations of the crimes public or private by the catholic hierarchy the croatian catholic church and vatican in fact viewed policies against serbs as advantegous to roman catholicism nevertheless historian tomasevich praised some of the public statements and deeds made by archbishop aloysius stepinac but noted that there were shortcomings in statements and actions regarding genocidal actions against the serbs and the serbian orthodox church in his diary stepinac said that serbs and croats are of two different worlds north and south pole which will never unite as long as one of them is alive along with other similar views croatia rehabilitation of stepinac in met negative reaction in serbia and republika srpska expulsion an estimated serbs were deported from ndh to german occupied serbia and fled by the general plan was to have prominent people deported first so their property could be nationalized and the remaining serbs could then be more easily manipulated by the end of september about half of the serbian orthodox clergy priests had been expelled victims and death toll during the war and during tito yugoslavia various numbers were given for overall war casualties estimations by holocaust memorial centers also vary as concluded by historian rory yeomans the most conservative estimates put the lower number of and possibly as many as serbs killed by ustashe death squads executed or perished at concentration camps tomasevich said that the exact number of victims in yugoslavia is impossible to determine sabrina ramet estimated at least serbs massacred by the ustaše demographer bogoljub kočović author of the most serious study of world war ii victims in yugoslavia estimated serbs who died in ndh the number of victims at the jasenovac concentration camp remains matter of debate but current estimates put the number at around about half of which were serbs in serbia and in the eyes of serbs the ustashe atrocities constituted genocide some western and jewish authors acknowledge it as genocide or if not calling it explicitly genocide call ustashe policies and acts genocidal lemkin also called hungarian and bulgarian policies against serbs genocidal aftermath after world war ii most of the remaining ustashe went underground or fled to countries such as australia canada the united states and germany with the assistance of roman catholic clerics and grassroots supporters the yugoslav communist government did not use the jasenovac camp as was done with other european concentration camps most likely due to serb croat relations tito government attempted to let the wounds heal and forge brotherhood and unity in the peoples tito himself was invited and passed jasenovac several times but did never visit the site ratlines terrorism and assassinations with the partisan liberation of yugoslavia many ustashe leaders fled and took refuge at the college of san girolamo degli illirici near the vatican catholic priest and ustashe krunoslav draganović directed the fugitives from san girolamo the us state department and counter intelligence corps helped war criminals to escape and assisted draganović who later worked for the american intelligence in sending ustashe abroad many of those responsible for mass killings in ndh took refuge in south america portugal spain and the united states luburić was assassinated in spain in by an udba agent artuković lived in ireland and california until extradited in and died of natural causes in prison dinko šakić and his wife nada lived in argentina until extradited in dinko dying in prison and his wife released draganović also arranged gestapo functionary klaus barbie flight in the croat diaspora the ustashe became heroes ustashe émigré terrorist groups in the diaspora

brother satan captured by partisans tried and executed in petar brzica franciscan friar who won contest on august after cutting the throats of inmates at the jasenovac camp his post war fate is unknown controversy revisionism in modern day croatia some croats including politicians have attempted to minimise the magnitude of the genocide perpetrated against serbs in the world war ii puppet state of germany the independent state of croatia franjo tuđman the late president of croatia confirmed that genocide happened during world war ii by the future president of croatia franjo tuđman who had been partisan during world war ii had embraced croatian nationalism and published horrors of war historical reality and philosophy in which he questioned the official number of victims killed by the ustaše during the second world war in his book tuđman claimed that fewer than thirty thousand people died at jasenovac tuđman also estimated that total of jews had perished in the holocaust tuđman views and his government toleration of ustaša symbols frequently strained relations with israel nonetheless in his book he did confirm that genocide happened possibly the most overt and well known example of anti serb sentiment in contemporary croatian public life is thompson croatian rock band that has been protested against on numerous occasions for having sung ustaše songs most notably jasenovac gradiška stara people publicly displaying ustaše affiliations at major thompson concerts in croatia and elsewhere is frequent occurrence leading to complaints from the simon wiesenthal center in video was leaked showing croatian president stipe mesić giving speech in australia in the early in which he said that the croats had won great victory on april th the date of the formation of the independent state of croatia in and that croatia needed to apologize to no one for jasenovac later on mesić apologized for his indecent statement and stated that he undoubtedly considered anti fascism to be the basis of modern day croatia appreciated yugoslav partisans and considered it necessary to reaffirm anti fascism as human and civilization commitment in the function of the unavoidable condition for the building of democratic croatia country of equal citizens on april in commemoration ceremony croatian president ivo josipović warned that there were attempts to drastically reduce or decrease the number of jasenovac victims adding faced with the devastating truth here that certain members of the croatian people were capable of committing the cruelest of crimes want to say that all of us are responsible for the things that we do at the same ceremony then croatian prime minister jadranka kosor said there is no excuse for the crimes and therefore the croatian government decisively rejects and condemns every attempt at historical revisionism and rehabilitation of the fascist ideology every form of totalitarianism extremism and radicalism pavelić regime was regime of evil hatred and intolerance in which people were abused and killed because of their race religion nationality their political beliefs and because they were the others and were different revisionism in croat diaspora in in melbourne australia croat restaurant held celebration to honour ustaše leader ante pavelić the event was an outrageous affront both to his victims and to any persons of morality and conscience who oppose racism and genocide dr efraim zuroff of the simon wiesenthal center stated according to local press reports large photograph of pavelić was hung in the restaurant shirts with his picture and that of two other commanders in the ustaše government were offered for sale at the bar and the establishment of the independent state of croatia was celebrated zuroff noted this was not the first time that croatian émigrés in australia had openly defended croat nazi war criminals it is high time that the authorities in australia find way to take the necessary measures to stop such celebrations which clearly constitute racist ethnic and anti semitic incitement against serbs jews and gypsies ustaše gold the ustaše had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from serbian and jewish property owners during world war ii into swiss bank accounts of total of million swiss francs about million was seized by british troops however the remaining million ca million dollars reached the vatican in october the american intelligence agency ssu alleged that these funds are still held in the vatican bank this matter is the crux of recent class action suit against the vatican bank and other defendants legacy yugoslav wars world war ii and especially its ethnic conflicts have been deemed instrumental in the later yugoslav wars commemoration israeli president moshe katsav visited jasenovac in his successor shimon peres paid homage to the camp victims when he visited jasenovac on july and laid wreath at the memorial peres

wrote the first draft seven years ago while relaxing on palolem beach in goa in an interview she said hand wrote it and it was some ridiculous epic length when came back and transcribed it on my laptop the first film is the easiest to write because it usually what the person knows their personal graphs milieu and feelings luck by chance is not about established actors but those who are waiting for things to happen farhan character is fresh off the boat while konkana does bit roles looking for big break the production team went through host of names like madhuri dixit saif ali khan kajol karisma kapoor and tabu having seen lot of struggling actors come to mumbai to make living out of bollywood zoya found it was easy to write the script for the film without any research she was inspired to write this movie by lot of bollywood inspired movies like guddi rangeela and om shanti om javed akhtar wrote the dialogues for the film incorporating as zoya puts it his bizarre sense of humour farhan had to reportedly train to get six pack abs for the film he was trained by cheetah yagnesh who appeared on the film as farhan character trainer filming faced lot of problems including the unpredictable mumbai rains which halted song shoot with hrithik roshan the rains washed out the entire set and eventually the entire tent began to leak zoya was afraid that this would lead to short circuit and so all the lights had to be switched off according to farhan principal photography for the film was completed in october casting zoya akhtar cast her brother farhan to play the lead role after it was suggested to her by director reema kagti she became convinced after seeing farhan performance in fakir of venice she said in an interview farhan was the perfect choice for the role in luck by chance because he knows the industry in and out he is smart and bright and both of us have been working together for years problems arose with the huge casting of the film zoya said had to really think it out when was deciding on these multiple actors that wanted in the film it was tough to decide especially because wanted the right actors who could play themselves and still look believable as part of the film then there are other good actors like boman irani and saurabh shukla who are playing characters in the film next to be cast were her parents javed akhtar and shabana azmi along with such veteran stars as rishi kapoor and dimple kapadia zoya said we could have had shabana azmi as the diva but needed mainstream heroine only leading lady would do dimple has played it

the united states canada uk uae australia south africa and new zealand reception critical reception the film was well received by critics anupama chopra of ndtv wrote zoya pokes fun at bollywood but she does it with great affection there are some lovely little moments like the star daughter in super short skin tight outfit struggling to touch her producer feet without splitting seam but what makes luck by chance compelling is the layers beneath the laughs though the first half wobbles precariously as the script struggles to find momentum but thankfully the narrative flows better in the latter half and culminates in satisfying bittersweet end in the review at uae daily the united arab emirates reviewer said one of the prime reasons why luck by chance works is because of the writing right from the characters to the individualistic scenes to the way zoya puts them in sequence luck by chance is easily one of the most cohesive scripts this side of the atlantic if zoya writing is superb her execution of the written material deserves distinction marks the times of india said luck by chance highlights how the film industry give regards to everything else but the story when

      "technicians carefully position an orion flight test crew module to be airlifted this module will be used for the orion launch abort system pad abort flight test nasa newest spacecraft the orion multi purpose crew vehicle mpcv will be the first american spacecraft since project apollo to use an escape system in the event of launch abort something its predecessor the space shuttle had for only its first four orbital test flights in like the apollo command service module csm the orion cev will use the launch escape system les solid fueled tractor rocket that will be able to pull the orion crew module away from malfunctioning space launch system sls rocket during the initial launch phase based on the launch escape system found on the soviet russian soyuz spacecraft the las designed and manufactured by atk for the orion cev will be larger than the soyuz version and will have more thrust than the atlas booster that carried astronaut john glenn into orbit in the earlier apollo system had various abort modes depending on altitude velocity and other circumstances likewise the orion will have similar modes of operation for its launch performance aborts some of these may not use the las itself but would use the second stage of the ares or even the orion vehicle own propulsion system the aerojet aj engine instead initially designed to land on solid ground like that of the early and current soviet and russian manned spacecraft vostok voskhod and soyuz with water landing as backup in august nasa tentatively redesigned the orion for water landings splashdowns as the primary mode of landing with ground landings as the emergency backup under the advice of the exploration systems architecture study esas report nasa will most likely develop abort procedures that resemble the abort procedures used on apollo but with some procedures carried over from the shuttle modes the method of abort either using the las or the second stage of the space launch system booster will depend on how far into the flight the spacecraft and crew are traveling prelaunch nasa has acquired several mraps to station near the launch pad should there be time for the crew to evacuate the vehicle one will be occupied by emergency rescue personnel while the other will stand empty behind blast shelter pad emergency egress enables astronauts and engineers to quickly escape the perimeter of the rocket both zip lines and roller coasters were at one time studied for this purpose mode one during the first seconds of flight up to the jettisoning of the solid fueled boosters at the orion crew module cm will separate from the rest of the rocket propelled by the las unlike the apollo launch escape system which used pair of canards and the weight of the spacecraft to flip the vehicle over for landing the orion las has set of steering rockets that will steer the spacecraft away from the malfunctioning sls as well as prepare the spacecraft for both separation and splashdown the tower will then be jettisoned seconds later and the hypergolic fuel on the orion cm would be automatically released at pre determined altitude mode two after the las is jettisoned the orion crew and service modules csm will separate as whole from the sls and either use its large aj engine or smaller control engines to maneuver from the rocket similar to space shuttle trans atlantic tal abort profile the orion will use the aj engine to propel the spacecraft to desired separation point in which then the orion cm would land in either western spain or morocco on due east lunar flights or in ireland or the united kingdom on iss bound flights splashdown in the eastern atlantic ocean would only be contingency mode three the sls would propel the orion csm into an initial orbit upon which the spacecraft will immediately separate and then perform retrofire that will allow the orion cm to splashdown in the pacific ocean off the west coast or make ground landing at either edwards air force base in california or white sands space harbor in new mexico this is similar in profile to the shuttle abort once around aoa profile mode four if the sls suffers less than ideal performance during the initial orbit insertion it can be restarted minutes later to place the orion csm into less than ideal orbit that can be corrected with the on board propellant reserves later in the flight this is similar to the shuttle abort to orbit ato profile but depending upon the stable orbit reached it may require nasa to end the mission with landing at either edwards or white sands within hour period the four abort modes would also be used if the max launch abort system mlas proposed alternative to the las is flown in place of the las the mlas which resembles the las but without the soyuz like rocket tower uses

      "biologist pz myers pharyngula blog founded and written by pz myers is hosted on scienceblogs in full and present in part and on present in the science journal nature listed it as the top ranked blog written by scientist based on popularity the blog addresses range of topics including myers academic specialty biology it has become particularly well known for myers writing style characterized by sarcasm and for his criticism of intelligent design and creationism in hemant mehta ranked pharyngula the most popular atheist blog based on subscriber levels and other factors history according to alexa internet pharyngula org was started on june it started out as an experiment in writing instruction for class students were required to submit mini essays to be published online after the project was finished myers still had the web publishing software and started to use it personally the blog is named after his favourite stage in embryonic development the pharyngula stage pharyngula moved to hosting at scienceblogs in in myers reviewed stuart pivar book lifecode which argues that self organization at the embryonic and fetal stages determines the development and final structure of organisms myers reviewed the book negatively stating that the diagrams and ideas in the book arose from pivar imagination and had no basis in actual evidence after some discussion in the comments threads of pharyngula pivar sued myers for libel within week pivar withdrew the lawsuit stating that the real issue got sidelined and that his problem was more with seed media group in june myers commented on national press reports that university of central florida student took host eucharist wafer from catholic mass in response to forcible attempts to stop him from carrying it back to his seat where he claimed he planned to show it to fellow student who was curious about the catholic faith after death threats were directed against the student by some who were offended by the student behavior myers composed his first blog post on the topic after describing the harassment leveled against the student he asked readers to acquire for him consecrated eucharistic hosts which he might show you sacrilege gladly and with much fanfare and could treat with profound disrespect and heinous cracker abuse all photographed and presented here on the web bill donohue catholic league responded with letter demanding the university of minnesota and the minnesota state legislature take action against myers proponents of this action noted that myers blog could be reached from his university web page myers has received several death threats and much hate mail over the controversy in august myers and others founded new blog network to host pharyngula and other blogs in the atheist secular field according to myers the move was made as an acceptable compromise between him and national geographic who at that time would be taking more active role in hosting the scienceblogs stable and therefore bringing their standards practices which are different from the more freewheeling policies of seed media and would cause culture clash myers stated that natgeo and have worked out an acceptable compromise this site on is not in any way associated with national geographic and that he would only cross post to his original site on scienceblogs whatever write that feel is compatible with the more conservative ethos of national geographic as such since august the complete pharyngula has appeared on and limited selection of those posts the more science focused ones are cross posted to the scienceblogs hosted version in september myers announced that blogger and chris clarke would become pharyngula co author clarke left the blog in august partly because of the perceived unpleasantness of pharyngula commenters content myers often criticizes intelligent design creationism and movements and posts on subjects such as science religion politics superstition and education his experience in evolutionary developmental biology and as teacher provides depth to the subjects of science and education one theme that arises regularly is that of cephalopods creatures that myers finds quite fascinating creationism in particular myers frequently offers specific criticisms of creationism including intelligent design as well as the discovery institute answers in genesis and other groups that promote ideas for example in february and march he focused many of his posts on creationist neurosurgeon michael egnor who had recently joined the discovery institute in addition to myers criticisms of egnor arguments on evolution and intelligent design myers criticized the discovery institute reliance on someone whose expertise wasn relevant to evolution in early april myers participated in an april fool day joke arranged by the panda thumb which manufactured website spoofing the discovery institute page on which egnor admitted that his association with the discovery institute was itself an april fool joke this elaborate prank succeeded in fooling many of his readers while others succeeded in spotting jokes in the design of the false discovery institute page and concluded that this admission was itself the prank he made point the following day that he perceived it as getting exceedingly difficult to believe some creationists were for real cf poe law and highlighted quote by stephen meyer memes pygmies and dwarfs in june myers criticized cartoon by biblical literalist jim pinkoski which claimed that the biblical line there were giants in the earth in those days genesis was literally intended to convey that early humans were much taller than their modern counterparts pinkoski placed adam at tall and noah at tall what myers found most interesting about this cartoon however was the note on it which read literally note if you doubt this is possible how is it there are pygmies dwarfs myers argued that the existence of pygmies and dwarfs now is non sequitur when it comes to whether humans were tall years ago if pinkoski claims were valid humans would perhaps continue to decrease in height and approach that small size at some time in the future but this does not mean those small humans would exist now barring the use of time travel claim pinkoski never makes myers went on to mock the irrelevance of this argument with parodies such as ever wonder how the hell moron like george bush got elected if you doubt this is possible how is it there are pygmies dwarfs how can people be so gullible to believe the nonsense peddled by the discovery institute if you doubt this is possible how is it there are pygmies dwarfs the phrase has since been picked up by various bloggers to ridicule creationist arguments and is also popular with commenters at the panda thumb the phrase is generally capitalized and bolded to match how it originally appeared in pinkoski cartoon the courtier reply myers has voiced the position that many of the responses to richard dawkins the god delusion are what he calls courtier replies replying to critics who felt that dawkins ignored sophisticated versions of modern theology myers compared them to courtiers fawning on the legendary emperor who had no clothes in other words critics complain about dawkins not studying aspects of theology that are irrelevant to whether or not god exists in the same way as scholarly writings about imperial fashion are irrelevant when the emperor is naked dawkins himself quoted the courtier reply in debate with alister mcgrath he also referenced the courtier reply in the preface to the god delusion paperback edition blake law another recurring trope has been myers reaction to the label fundamentalist atheist bestowed by some upon him dawkins and others who espouse similar views myers writes the new atheism don like that phrase either is about taking core set of principles that have proven themselves powerful and useful in the scientific world you ve probably noticed that many of these uppity atheists are coming out of scientific background and insisting that they also apply to everything else people do these principles are reliance on natural causes and demanding explanations in terms of the real world with documentary chain of evidence that anyone can examine the virtues are critical thinking flexibility openness verification and evidence the sins are dogma faith tradition revelation superstition and the supernatural there is no holy writ and central idea is that everything must be open to rational evidence based criticism it the opposite of fundamentalism eventually myers summarized his stance by invoking blake law named for pharyngula commentator blake stacey as formulated by stacey in based in concept on godwin law in any discussion of atheism skepticism etc the probability that someone will compare vocal atheist to religious fundamentalists increases to one feminism myers is strongly feminist and has written about discrimination against women deep rifts myers has made frequent use of the phrase deep rifts to satirize perceptions that atheism could experience religious schism over disagreements on marketing atheism or the role of science and religion myers does not deny there are some differences of opinion between prominent atheists but contends this is good thing and is attributed to the freethinking nature of atheism see also creation evolution controversy popular science scientific skepticism scienceblogs references external links pharyngula at pharyngula at scienceblogs\n",

important place in production at times denominational work was set aside to accommodate the commercial it was felt that commercial work was necessary to keep the machinery going and profits coming in mrs white encouraged management to move away from the city which was developing so rapidly around the plant the town of mountain view wished to raise its status in the state the town leaders upon hearing that the pacific seventh day adventist publishing association in oakland which had gained fair and growing reputation was looking for more rural atmosphere in which to establish itself offered the press five choice acres of land as well as pair of lots for church or meeting house the press accepted the offer of the of land and in they moved to mountain view along with the plant came the families as result real estate in mountain view began to advance and area business grew brick building soon took shape on the land donated by the town and work began to come in from customers who patronized the plant in oakland mrs white implored management to rely on god alone and give up the commercial work that had followed them from oakland and had received priority over church publications at in the morning of april great earthquake convulsed the whole bay area the walls of the plant crumbled its offices were in shambles yet within few days the presses were running again on

had become blazing inferno although the fire was finally subdued it was not entirely extinguished and it broke out second time this time scarcely charred board remained the paper stock of the plant

      "the story of vasistha and arundhati shown begins the text yoga vasistha iast is philosophical text attributed to valmiki but the real author is unknown the complete text contains over verses the short version of the text is called laghu yogavasistha and contains verses the exact century of its completion is unknown but has been estimated to be somewhere between th century to as late as th century but it is likely that version of the text existed in the st millennium the text is named after sage vasistha who is mentioned and revered in the seventh book of the rigveda and who was called as the first sage of the vedanta school of hindu philosophy by adi shankara the text is structured as discourse of sage vasistha to prince rama the text consists of six books the first book presents rama frustration with the nature of life human suffering and disdain for the world the second describes through the character of rama the desire for liberation and the nature of those who seek such liberation the third and fourth books assert that liberation comes through spiritual life one that requires self effort and present cosmology and metaphysical theories of existence embedded in stories these two books are known for emphasizing free will and human creative power the fifth book discusses meditation and its powers in liberating the individual while the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful rama yoga vasistha teachings are structured as stories and fables with philosophical foundation similar to those found in advaita vedanta is particularly associated with drsti srsti subschool of advaita which holds that the whole world of things is the object of mind the text is notable for expounding the principles of maya and brahman as well as the principles of non duality and its discussion of yoga the short form of the text was translated into persian by the th century yoga vasistha is famous as one of the historically popular and influential texts of hinduism other names of this text are maha ramayana arsha ramayana vasiṣṭha ramayana yogavasistha ramayana and jnanavasistha nomenclature the name vasistha in the title of the text refers to rishi vasistha the term yoga in the text refers to the underlying yogic theme in its stories and dialogues and the term is used in generic sense to include all forms of yoga in the pursuit of liberation in the style of bhagavad gita the long version of the text is called brihat yoga vasistha wherein brihat means great or large the short version of the text is called laghu yoga vasishta wherein laghu means short or small the longer version is also referred to simply as yoga vasistha and by numerous other names such as vasiṣṭha ramayana chronology the date or century of the text composition or compilation is unknown and variously estimated from the content and references it makes to other literature other schools of indian philosophies scholars agree that the surviving editions of the text were composed in the common era but disagree whether it was completed in the first millennium or second estimates range states chapple from as early as the sixth or seventh century to as late as the fourteenth century the surviving text mentions vijnanavada and madhyamika schools of buddhism by name suggesting that the corresponding sections were composed after those schools were established or about th century the translation of version of the text in th to th century into persian has been the basis the other limit among scholars such as farquhar in atreya in suggested that the text must have preceded gaudapada and adi shankara because it does not use their terminology but does mention many buddhist terms dasgupta contemporary of atreya states that the text includes verses of earlier text such as its iii is identical to one found in kalidasa kumarasambhava thus the text must be placed after the th century dasgupta adds that the philosophy and ideas presented in yoga vasistha mirror those of found in advaita vedanta of adi shankara but neither mention the other which probably means that the author of yoga vasistha were scholars who lived in the same century as shankara placing the text in about th to early th century the shorter summary version of the text is attributed to the kashmiri scholar abhinanda who has been variously dated to have lived in th or th century evolving text theory mainkar states that yoga vasistha probably evolved over time the first work states mainkar was the original ancient work of vasistha that was an upanishad with brahamanical ideas work that is lost this text was suggests mainkar was expanded into moksopaya in or after th century which is now commonly known as laghu yogavasistha the laghu shorter version was then expanded into the full editions over time in the centuries that followed the completion of laghu yogavasistha the syncretic incorporation of buddhism and hinduism ideas happened in the laghu yogavasistha edition states mainkar while ideas from kashmiri shaivism particularly the trika school were added to the growing version by the th century similar serial expansion revisions and interpolation is typical in indian literature peter thomi has published additional evidence in support mainkar theory on yoga vasistha chronology the oldest surviving manuscript of the moksopaya or moksopaya shastra has been dated to have been composed in srinagar in the th century ad author the text is traditionally attributed to valmiki the author of ramayana scholars seriously doubt the larger version of the text was authored by valmiki and consider the attribution as mark of modest respect and reverence for him in the hindu tradition by the actual unknown author or compiler the author of the shorter version the laghu yogavasistha is generally considered to be abhinanda of kashmir structure the text exists in many editions of manuscripts with varying number of verses but similar message the full editions contain over to few with verses and in some editions about verses an abridged version by abhinanda of kashmir son of jayanta bhatta is known as the laghu little yogavasistha and contains verses the verses of yoga vasistha are structured in the genre of ancient indian literature called grantha in this genre each shloka verse in the text is designed to equal syllables while conveying its message grantha can be sung and depending on its meter set to specific raga music this genre is found in bhakti movement literature and yoga vasistha advaita theories and monism influenced the grantha literature of sikhism whose primary scripture is called guru granth sahib the yoga vasistha is syncretic work containing elements of vedanta yoga samkhya saiva siddhanta jainism and mahayana buddhism thus making it according to chapple hindu text par excellence including as does hinduism mosaic style amalgam of diverse and sometimes opposing traditions the text consists of six books book titled vairagya prakaranam exposition of dispassion which opens with rama frustrated with the nature of life human suffering and disdain for the world book titled prakaranam exposition of the behavior of the seeker which describes through the character of rama the desire for liberation the nature of those who seek such liberation and the need for self effort in all spiritual pursuits book titled utpatti prakaranam exposition of the arising and birth describes the birth of all creation as well as the birth of spiritual side of rama book titled sthiti prakaranam exposition of the existence and settling describes the nature of world and many non dualism ideas with numerous stories it emphasizes free will and human creative power book titled upashama prakaranam exposition of the patience and tranquility discusses meditation to dissolution false dualism to feel oneness and its powers in liberating the individual book titled nirvana prakaranam exposition of the freedom and liberation the last book describes the state of an enlightened and blissful rama the last book also has large sections on yoga the nirnaya sagar version of yoga vasistha manuscript has verses in the first book in second verses in third verses in the fourth book in the fifth while the last is longest with verses for cumulative total of verses content this is one of the longest hindu texts in sanskrit after the mahabharata and an important text of yoga it consists of numerous short stories and anecdotes used to help illustrate its ideas and message the text shows the influence of advaita vedanta and saivite trika school in terms of hindu mythology the conversation in the yoga vasishta is placed chronologically before the ramayana the traditional belief is that reading this book leads to spiritual liberation the conversation between vasistha and prince rama is that between great enlightened sage and seeker of liberation the text discusses consciousness cosmology nature of the universe and consciousness the ultimate dissolution of body the liberation of the soul and the non dual nature of existence on who is ready for spiritual knowledge the yoga vasistha states that there are four characteristics that mark someone who is ready for spiritual journey senses the difference between atman soul and non atman is past cravings for anyone or anything is indifferent to the enjoyments of objects in this world or after is virtuous and ethical with sama equality dama self restraint temperance uparati quietism titiksha patience endurance sandhana uniting peace and sraddha faith trust has mumukshatawa that is longing for meaning in life and liberation on the process of spiritual knowledge yoga vasistha teachings are divided into six parts dispassion qualifications of the seeker creation existence dissolution and liberation it sums up the spiritual process in the seven bhoomikas śubhecchā longing for the truth the yogi or sādhaka rightly distinguishes between permanent and impermanent cultivates dislike for worldly pleasures acquires mastery over his physical and mental organism and feels deep yearning to be free from saṃsāra vicāraṇa right inquiry the yogi has pondered over what he or she has read and heard and has realized it in his or her life tanumānasa attenuation or thinning out of mental activities the mind abandons the many and remains fixed on the one sattvāpatti attainment of sattva reality the yogi at this stage is called brahmavid knower of brahman in the previous four stages the yogi is subject to sañcita prārabdha and āgamī forms of karma he or she has been practicing samprajñāta samādhi contemplation in which the consciousness of duality still exists asaṃsakti unaffected by anything the yogi now called brahmavidvara performs his or her necessary duties without sense of involvement padārtha abhāvana sees brahman everywhere external things do not appear to exist to the yogi now called in essence there is non cognition of objects as the separation between subject and distinct object is dissolved and tasks get performed without any sense of agency doership sañcita and āgamī karma are now destroyed only small amount of prārabdha karma remains turīya perpetual samādhi the yogi is known as and does not perform activities either by his will or the promptings of others on liberation in chapter of book vi titled as the story of iksvaku the text explains the state of nirvana liberation as follows liberation is peace liberation is extinction of all conditioning liberation is freedom from every kind of physical psychological and psychic distress this world is not seen by the ignorant and the wise in the same light to one who has attained self knowledge this world does not appear as samsara but as the one infinite and indivisible consciousness on jivanmukta the yoga vasistha describes the jivanmukta or liberated person as follows abridged from the translation by kn aiyer he associates with the wise he has reached the state of mind which sees happiness everywhere to him neither sacrificial fires nor tapas nor bounteous gifts nor holy waters have any meaning he is replete with wisdom and friendly to all he is desireless and in his eyes there is nothing supernatural his state is indescribable and yet he will move in the world like anybody else his mind will not be bound by any longings after karmas he will be indifferent to joy or pains arising from good or bad results he will preserve pleasant position in the happy enjoyment of whatever he obtains he is never affected by anything whether he is in state of jiva consciousness or state of shiva devoid of the jiva consciousness he is same whether he moves in family or is solitary recluse he feels unbound by the delusions of srutis and smritis nothing matters to him he is unaffected by griefs or pleasures he is distant he is close he in the one reality of atman he is neither clingy nor arrogant he has no fear of anyone no anger against anyone when the attraction towards external objects ceases then there yet remains the internal craving which is called trishna thirst the jivanmukta is beyond trishna he is not becoming he does not even long for salvation he is content jivanmukta will always transact his present duties but neither longs for things in the future nor ruminates upon things of the past he is child amongst children as old men amongst the old as the puissant amongst the puissant as youth amongst the young compassionate and understanding with the grieved in him is found nobleness benevolence love clearness of intellect on samsara and reality the yoga vasistha describes samsara and reality as follows samsara is mundane existence with rebirths the universe is full of samsara driven by moha delusion bondage tamas destructive chaotic behaviors mala impurity avidya and maya ignorance feeds samsara self knowledge liberates samsara is ephemeral and unreal with birth death is inevitable commentaries the following traditional sanskrit commentaries on the yoga vasistha are extant vāsiṣṭha rāmāyaṇa candrikā by advayāraṇya son of narahari tātparya prakāśa by ānanda bodhendra sarasvatī bhāṣya by gaṅgādharendra pada candrikā by mādhava sarasvatī influence yoga vasistha is considered one of the most important texts of the vedantic philosophy the text states david gordon white has served as reference on yoga for medieval era advaita vedanta scholars the yoga vasistha adds white was one of the popular texts on yoga that dominated the indian yoga culture scene before the th century indian freedom fighter vinayak damodar savarkar has praised yoga vasistha quotes from his autobiography my transportation for life all of sudden fell upon the yoga vashistha and found it of such absorbing interest that have come to regard it ever since as the best work on the vedanta philosophy the propositions were so logical the verse is so beautiful and the exposition is so thorough and penetrating that the soul loses itself in raptures over it such fine combination of philosophy and poetry is gift reserved only for sanskrit poets when used to be lost in the reading of the yoga vashistha the coil of rope was weaving dropped automatically from my hands and for hours on end lost the sense of possessing the body and the senses associated with that body my foot would not move and my hand was at stand still felt the deeper yearning to surrender it all all propaganda all work seemed such worthless task sheer waste of life at last the mind and the matter asserted their sway over the body and swung it back to work again the practice of atma vichara self enquiry described in the yoga vasistha has been popularised due to the influence of ramana maharshi who was strongly influenced by this text

      "supercritical fluid chromatography sfc is form of normal phase chromatography that uses supercritical fluid such as carbon dioxide as the mobile phase it is used for the analysis and purification of low to moderate molecular weight thermally labile molecules and can also be used for the separation of chiral compounds principles are similar to those of high performance liquid chromatography hplc however sfc typically utilizes carbon dioxide as the mobile phase therefore the entire chromatographic flow path must be pressurized because the supercritical phase represents state in which liquid and gas properties converge supercritical fluid chromatography is sometimes called convergence chromatography applications sfc is used in industry primarily for separation of chiral molecules and uses the same columns as standard hplc systems sfc is now commonly used for achiral separations and purifications in the pharmaceutical industry apparatus sfc with co utilizes carbon dioxide pumps that require that the incoming co and pump heads be kept cold in order to maintain the carbon dioxide at temperature and pressure that keeps it in liquid state where it can be effectively metered at some specified flow rate the co subsequently becomes supercritical post the injector and in the column oven when the temperature and pressure it is subjected to are raised above the critical point of the liquid and the supercritical state is achieved sfc as chromatographic process has been likened to process having the combined properties of the power of liquid to dissolve matrix with the chromatographic interactions and kinetics of gas the result is that you can get lot of mass on column per injection and still maintain high chromatographic efficiency typically gradient elution is employed in analytical sfc using polar co solvent such as methanol possibly with weak acid or base at low concentrations the effective plate counts per analysis can be observed to exceed plates per metre routinely with um material the operator uses software to set mobile phase flow rate co solvent composition system back pressure and column oven temperature which must exceed for supercritical conditions to be achieved with co in addition sfc provides an additional control parameter pressure by using an automated back pressure regulator from an operational standpoint sfc is as simple and robust as hplc but fraction collection is more convenient because the primary mobile phase evaporates leaving only the analyte and small volume of polar co solvent if the outlet co is captured it can be recompressed and recycled allowing for reuse of co similar to hplc sfc uses variety of detection methods including uv vis mass spectrometry fid unlike hplc and evaporative light scattering sample preparation rule of thumb is that any molecule that will dissolve in methanol or less polar solvent is compatible with sfc including polar solutes co has polarity similar to heptane at its critical point but the solvent strength can be increased by increasing density or using polar cosolvent in practice when the fraction of cosolvent is high the mobile phase is not truly supercritical but this terminology is used regardless mobile phase the mobile phase is composed primarily of supercritical carbon dioxide but since co on its own is too non polar to effectively elute many analytes cosolvents are added to modify the mobile phase polarity cosolvents are typically simple alcohols like methanol ethanol or isopropyl alcohol other solvents such as acetonitrile chloroform or ethyl acetate can be used as modifiers for food grade materials the selected cosolvent is often ethanol or ethyl acetate both of which are generally recognized as safe gras the solvent limitations are system and column based drawbacks there have been few technical issues that have limited adoption of sfc technology first of which is the high pressure operating conditions high pressure vessels are expensive and bulky and special materials are often needed to avoid dissolving gaskets and rings in the supercritical fluid second drawback is difficulty in maintaining pressure backpressure regulation whereas liquids are nearly incompressible so their densities are constant regardless of pressure supercritical fluids are highly compressible and their physical properties change with pressure such as the pressure drop across packed bed column currently automated backpressure regulators can maintain constant pressure in the column even if flow rate varies mitigating this problem third drawback is difficulty in gas liquid separation during collection of product upon the co rapidly turns into gas and aerosolizes any dissolved analyte in the process cyclone separators have lessened difficulties in gas liquid separations references\n",

      "saint denis of paris upright thumb cephalophore from the greek for head carrier is saint who is generally depicted carrying his or her own head in christian art this was usually meant to signify that the subject in question had been martyred by beheading handling the halo in this circumstance offers unique challenge for the artist some put the halo where the head used to be others have the saint carrying the halo along with the head and some split the difference associated legends often tell of the saint standing and carrying his own head after the beheading the term cephalophore was first used in french article by marcel hébert les martyrs céphalophores euchaire elophe et libaire in revue de université de bruxelles possible origins the topos can be traced to two sources in homily on saints juventinus and maximinus john chrysostom asserted that the severed head of martyr was more terrifying to the devil than when it was able to speak he then compared soldiers showing their wounds received in battle to martyrs holding their severed head in their hands and presenting it to christ the other source was the western vita of saint denis founder of the see of paris who was identified in the text with dionysius the areopagite john the baptist the best known beheaded saint is not considered cephalophore since he did not hold his own head in his hands saint denis thus an original and perhaps the most famous cephalophore is denis patron saint of paris who according to the golden legend miraculously preached with his head in his hands while journeying the seven miles from montmartre to his burying place although st denis is the best known of the saintly head carriers there were many others the folklorist émile nourry counted no less than examples of cephalophory in french hagiographic literature alone given the frequency with which relics were stolen in medieval europe stories like this in which saint clearly indicates his or her chosen burial site may have developed as way of discouraging such acts of furta sacra examples of cephalophoric saints cephalophoric legend of nicasius of rheims tells that at the moment of his execution nicasius was reading psalm psalm in the vulgate when he reached the verse adhaesit pavimento anima mea my soul is attached unto dust verse he was decapitated after his head had fallen to the ground nicasius continued the psalm adding vivifica me domine secundum verbum tuum revive me lord with your words the theme of the speaking head is extended in the th century passio of saint justus of beauvais after the child had been beheaded by roman soldiers his father and brother found the corpse sitting with his head in his lap giving the head to his father justus asked him to carry it to auxerre that his mother felicia might kiss it saint aphrodisius martyr of alexandria venerated at béziers the legend of aphrodisius of alexandria was transferred to béziers where his name was inserted at the head of the list of bishops in the hagiographic accounts aphrodisius was accompanied by his camel as he was preaching group of pagans pressed through the crowd and beheaded him on the spot aphrodisius picked up his head and carried it to the chapel which he had recently consecrated at the site it is identified today as place saint aphrodise béziers saint gemolo is said to have survived his decapitation and after collecting his head climbed on horseback he rode to meet his uncle bishop on small mountain before he finally died legend associated with saint ginés de la jara states that after he was decapitated in southern france he picked up his head and threw it into the rhône the head was carried by the sea to the coast of cartagena in spain where it was venerated as relic cartagena was the center of this saint cult in the golden legend paul the apostle at his martyrdom stretched forth his neck and so was beheaded and as soon as the head was from the body it said jesus christus which had been to jesus or christus or both fifty times when the head was recovered and was to be rejoined to the body as relic in response to prayer for confirmation that this was indeed the right head the body of paul turned to rejoin the head that had been set at its feet in legend the female saint osyth stood up after her execution picking up her head like saint denis in paris and other cephalophoric martyrs and walking with it in her hands to the door of local convent before collapsing there similarly valerie of limoges carried her severed head away to her confessor saint martial saint cuthbert of lindisfarne is often depicted with his head on his neck shoulders and carrying second head in his hands however he is not cephalophore the second head is that of saint oswald of northumbria who was

expect it to burn on water the board indicated morts would probably have been successful if they had claimed damages for direct damage by the oil to the slipway but this was minor and not part of the damages claimed although success on this count may have saved morts dock and engineering the costs of all the litigation for both parties across all three levels of court viscount simonds in his delivery for the privy council said that the counsel for morts had discredited their own position by arguing that it couldn have been bunkering oil because it wouldn burn on water the privy council advice soundly disapproved the rule established in re polemis as being out of the current of contemporary thought and held that to find party liable for negligence the damage must be reasonably foreseeable the council found that even though the crew were careless and breached their duty of care the resulting extensive damage by fire was not foreseeable by reasonable person although the minor damage of oil on metal on the slipway would have been foreseeable viscount simonds delivered the judgment of the board and said it is no doubt proper when considering tortious liability for negligence to analyse its elements and to say that the plaintiff must prove duty owed to him by the defendant breach of that duty by the defendant and consequent damage but there can be no liability until the damage has been done it is not the act but the consequences on which tortious liability is founded who knows or can be assumed to know all the processes of nature but if it would be wrong that man should be held liable for damage unpredictable by reasonable man because it was direct or natural equally it would be wrong that he should escape liability however indirect the damage if he foresaw or could reasonably foresee the intervening events which led to its being done it is principle of civil liability subject only to qualifications which have no present relevance that man must be considered to be responsible for the probable consequences of his act to demand more of him is too harsh rule to demand less is to ignore that civilised order requires the observance of minimum standard of behaviour significance up until this time the leading case had been re polemis where the central question was that of the directness of the chain of events between the triggering act being examined for negligence and the result the council decided that rather than go with precedent authority they would determine principle from range of cases in similar way as lord atkin did in donoghue stevenson and their principle was primarily single test for foreseeability which they argued was logical link between the damage and the liability culpability stated differently foreseeability was the logical link between and the test for breach of the duty of care and the damages this is the supreme test and may be rephrased as the liability of consequence was natural or necessary or probable the lords made reference to hindsight indicating it is nothing like foresight and should play no role in assessing negligence there is authority to challenge this view of hindsight in page smith lord lloyd stated in the case of secondary victims persons who were not participants in an accident the defendant will not be liable unless psychiatric injury is foreseeable in person of normal fortitude and it may be legitimate to use hindsight in order to be able to apply the test of reasonable foreseeability the lords gave morts the opportunity to sue in nuisance but there is no record of them testing this action in that tort the common law rules of causation have had their importance lessened by the promulgation of statute law in australia contributory negligence is now essential for many determinations and are covered by statutes such as the civil liability act south australia which has more recent counterparts in number of jurisdictions including new south wales see also english tort

      "relational dialectics is an interpersonal communication theory about close personal ties and relationships that highlights the tensions struggles and interplay between contrary tendencies the theory proposed respectively by leslie baxter and rawlins in defines communication patterns between relationship partners as the result of endemic dialectical tensions when making decisions desires and viewpoints that often contradict one another are brought up and lead to dialectical tensions leslie baxter and barbara montgomery exemplify these contradictory statements that arise from individuals experience dialectal tensions using common proverbs such as opposites attract but birds of feather flock together as well as two company three crowd but the more the merrier this does not mean these opposing tensions are fundamentally troublesome for the relationship on the contrary they simply bring forward discussion of the connection between two parties the relational dialectic is an elaboration on mikhail bakhtin idea that life is an open monologue and humans experience collisions between opposing desires and needs within relational communications baxter includes list of dialectical tensions that reminds us that relationships are constantly changing and that successful and satisfying relationships require constant attention although baxter description of relational dialectics is thorough it by no means is exact or all inclusive since we all experience different tensions in different ways history relational dialectics is the emotional and value based version of the philosophical dialectic it is rooted in the dynamism of the yin and yang like the classic yin and yang the balance of emotional values in relationship is always in motion and any value pushed to its extreme contains the seed of its opposite in the western world these ideas hark back to the greek philosopher heraclitus who held that the world was in constant flux like fire with creative and destructive forces on both sides of every process mikhail bakhtin russian scholar most known for his work in dialogism applied marxist dialectic to literary and rhetorical theory and criticism he illustrated the tensions that exists in the deep structure of all human experience for example he identified that the tension that exists between unity and difference bakhtin conceived the human dialectic as two forces analogous to the physical forces centripetal emotional forces tending towards unity and centrifugal emotional forces tending towards divergence like the yin and yang bakhtin forces have no ultimate resolution baxter took the deep structural analysis of bakhtin and applied it to communication theory she found bangha of axes where this dynamic tension operated later authors have added other axes approaches to relational dialectics the monologic approach frames contradictions as either or the dualistic approach frames contradictions as two separate entities and the dialectic approach contends that multiple points of view play off one another in every contradiction both and core concepts and assumptions there are four main concepts that form the backdrop of relational dialectics as well as four major assumptions relational dialectics assumes that relationships are not linear relational life is characterized by change contradiction is the fundamental fact of relational life and communication is central to organizing and negotiating relational contradictions the four core concepts of relational dialectics include contradiction totality process and praxis contradictions are the core concept of relational dialectics it is the dynamic interplay between unified oppositions contradiction is formed whenever two tendencies or forces are interdependent unity yet mutually negate one another negation for example in relationship one can simultaneously desire intimacy and distance totality suggests that contradictions in relationship are part of unified whole and cannot be understood in isolation in other words the dialectics cannot be separated and are intrinsically related to each other for example the tension between dependence and interdependence cannot be separated from the tension between openness and privacy both work to condition and define the other process relational dialectics must be understood in terms of social processes movement activity and change are functional properties rawlins for example instances such as an individual fluctuating between disclosure and secretiveness in addition the individual may move between periods of honest and open communication miller praxis is philosophical term for the concept of practical behavior or sometimes the experience of practicing in praxis the dialectic tensions are created and re created through the active participation and interaction in other words the practical experience of having relationship exposes one to the imposition of the needs and value of another as the relationship endures one own needs and values become apparent praxis focuses on the practical choices individuals make in the midst of the opposing needs and values dialectical tensions in turn the choices and actions themselves create re create and change the nature of the relationship and hence the dialectical tensions themselves research has recommended theories which further dialectical understanding in relationships such as in the marriage in the workplace etc relational dialectics further includes the idea of contextual dialectics or rather the idea that every relationship exists within specific place within specific culture from there we also see the raise of public and private real and ideal dialectics and the interplay between what we see on television in public life versus what experience within our private lives examples of this include politicians as well as tv shows according to west and turner the tension of the real and ideal dialectic is featured when we think of television shows like leave it to beaver we receive an idealized message of what family life is like and then when we look at the families we live in we have to contend with the troublesome realities of family life the tension between these two images forms this dialectic dialectics according to the original relational dialectic model there were many core tensions opposing values in any relationship these are autonomy and connectedness favoritism and impartiality openness and closedness novelty and predictability instrumentality and affection and finally equality and inequality autonomy and connectedness refers to the desire to have ties and connections with others versus the need to separate oneself as unique individual an example of autonomy and connectedness would be an athlete who wants to feel like they are part of team but also wanting to highlight their individual talents favoritism and impartiality refers to the desire to be treated fairly and impartially versus the desire to be seen and known as special for instance professor may want to be impartial by creating an attendance policy but makes exceptions for students who participate in class and have good grades demonstrating favoritism openness and closedness refers to the desire to be open and divulge information versus the desire to be exclusive and private when chatting with boss about one weekend there is the desire to be open however closedness is also at play as certain details are often left out because of the context novelty and predictability suggest that there is desire for the relationship to be predictable versus the desire for it to be original and new when creating scheduled meetings for board members the predictability may lie in fixed schedule however the novelty may be in scheduling varying number of locations to peak interests as well as inspiration instrumentality and affection is the desire for affection to be genuine versus the desire for affection to be motivated by benefits and perceived advantages of the relationship an example of this would be being in romantic relationship based on love and affection but maintaining it for benefits such as financial security finally equality and inequality refers to the desire to be considered as equals versus the desire to develop levels of superiority female in the military may seek treatment equivalent to that received by her male colleagues but requires special barracks and adjusted assignments according to the theory while most of us may embrace the ideals of closeness certainty and openness in our relationships the communication is not straight path towards these goals conflicts often produce the exact opposites internal dialect within the relationship external dialect between couple and community integration separation connection autonomy inclusion seclusion stability change certainty uncertainty conventionality uniqueness expression nonexpression openness closedness

things must be consistent but not mundane there must be balance between the expected and unexpected in order to keep relationship expression nonexpression is class of relational dialectics that includes openness closedness revelation concealment candor secrecy and transparency privacy in relationship it is important to keep some things between the two parties while other parts of the relationship are okay to allow the public to know about dialectics in relationships according to michaela meyer relational dialectics theory exposes tensions within interpersonal relationships while at the same time it assumes continual maintenance and repair of these tensions as result relational dialectics theory is incredibly useful for defining how tensions are managed within relationships extensive research has been done regarding the role dialectical tensions play in relationships as well as the various factors that influence the tensions and the degree to which they affect the relationship through studies of romantic relationships long distance relationships friendships and family relationships researchers have observed the existence and frequency of certain dialectical tensions within various types of relationships romantic relationships study of heterosexual married couples was designed to determine what types of dialectical tensions were most prevalent in antagonistic conflicts between spouses larry erbert found that the openness closedness dialectic was most commonly referenced through examples by participants research conducted by baxter and montgomery confirmed this finding and broke the dialectic down into four subcategories to further analyze its existence in romantic relationships openness with refers to an individual self disclosure of information to another in this idea three types of information are shared information deemed to be personal the individuals feelings or personal opinions and information regarding one individual relationship with the other openness to often this form of openness is labeled as being attentive or responsive people respond in cognitive affective and behavioral ways closedness with describes the type of nondisclosive talk that occurs between individuals it is most often identified as small talk being primarily superficial the talk is oriented around conversation that requires little or no self disclosure allowing for controlled level informational privacy closedness to some people experience stress and discomfort when listening to others problems in response to this some individuals attempt to distance themselves in order to discourage others from confiding in them research has been conducted to examine the autonomy connection dialectic when dealing with termination of romantic relationships in erin sahlestein and tim dun study they found that participants joint conversations and their breakup accounts reflect the two basic forms of contradiction both antagonistic and non antagonistic struggles were evident in these data furthermore the study discovered that while normally break ups are retroactively studied the autonomy connection dialectic is actually in full swing throughout the termination process as opposed to previous thought of as move from connection to autonomy study measuring the display of symbols by lesbian couples revealed that while same sex couples experience similar challenges that opposite sex partners do there are unique challenges that arise to these same sex couples these unique problems in turn give rise to unique dialectical tensions within the relationship re marriage in study that focused on dialectics in second marriages six tensions unique to remarriages emerged three tensions related to the remarried dyad old new many participants found that within their new marriage the brought with them ideas and expectations based on their previous or old marriages however participants recognized that they had since entered new marriage which would not necessarily carry over the previous old expectations or experiences emotional closeness distance participants expressed feelings of both emotional closeness and emotional distance with their new partners while participants found that they experienced emotional closeness with their second spouse they also found that either they or their new spouse had other close friends or family with whom they were close to past present many participants found that they do not discuss prior relationships or other things that relate to the past with their new partners yet the new couples remained open about issues and topics related to their present life three tensions also emerged from the remarried dyad and their social networks their time frame our time frame many participants expressed feeling tensions between adhering to time frame that felt right to the individual while acknowledging the expectations that they sensed from their friends and family members in regards to what an appropriate relationship and re marriage time frame would be dyadic revelation network revelation participants found that they desired to share information with their social network however sometimes their partner did not desire them to share such information with that particular network resulting in tensions among participants to decide between revealing to their partner and revealing information to their social network old new participants identified the tension that was created through interactions with friends and family from the old marriage while being in the new marriage participants managed this tension primarily through recalibration and reaffirmation where participants recognized that both sides had to be present in order for the relationship to exist long distance relationships based on research by sahlstein the uncertainty certainty dialectic is the most prevailing dialectic found in long distance relationships her work exposed uncertainty certainty as competing yet complementary need in interviews conducted with couples engaged in long distance relationships contradictions emerged for example couples were found to plan interactions in order to obtain level of spontaneity within this three different forms of the praxis of relational dialectics emerged segmentation referred to the partners ability to live separate independent lives when they were not together balance referred to the couple ability to plan conversations about the future of the relationship denial referring to the couple refusal to admit the effect distance is having on the relationship friendships william rawlins has examined the role of relational dialectics in regard to friendships the tension of instrumentality affection was found to be the most central to this type of relationship within friendships importance is placed on the ability to discern the level of affection for real friendships opposed to instrumentality for fake friendships aristotle friendship of virtue notion of caring for friends without instrumental purposes exemplifies this point the dichotomy of instrumentality affection cannot be ignored within friendships as affection may be offered in order to receive instrumental aid from friends this interweaving of concepts is what distinguishes different types of friendships while this remains true the subjectivity of the friends in question ultimately determines the outcome of how heavily instrumentality affection is applied in the workplace blended relationships are close friends that are part of the same work environment dialectical tensions occur in organizations as individuals attempt to balance their roles as employees while maintaining established friendships within their occupations it is not necessary however to have friend in organizations to experience dialectical contradictions stress occurs frequently on the individual level as human needs and desires oppose impartiality vs favoritism friends within organizations desire to provide each other with special support and assistance but organizations strive for equitable treatment and discourage bias openness vs closedness it is tendency of close friends to be open and honest with one another but organizations often expect level of confidentiality that places strain on friendships that value the sharing of information novelty and predictability feeling excited about restructuring of your organization but anxious since it may interrupt your routine and put stress on your current relationships instrumentality and affection inviting coworker to lunch with the intention of asking for support on project at work family relationships sibling relationships relational dialectics can be applied when considering the significant change in family life that siblings experience when one sibling moves out of the family home for the first time as part of the transition into adulthood as one sibling begins new phase of life this change is often accompanied by new friendships or romantic relationships that occur in his her new lifestyle along with new geographic separation both of which result in change in communication as the newly absent sibling begins new lifestyle beyond his her home the pre existing sibling relationship goes through various changes and transitions in study conducted on discursive struggles among siblings experiencing transition all participants acknowledged that moving away from their sibling resulted in discursive struggle between the old and new meanings in the sibling relationship two specific discursive struggles were identified old relationship new relationship for many siblings family rituals were not continued upon moving out resulting in change in relationship and feeling of missing out emphasizing the changes that occur during the transition from an old relationship into new ones certainty uncertainty participants found that the change from seeing sibling regularly to not seeing him her often resulted in feelings of uncertainty resulting in an identity shift in the relationship and supporting the discursive struggle of certainty uncertainty while participants addressed the varying tensions involved with lifestyle transitions of the participants in the study expressed that moving away from their sibling strengthened their connection and appreciation for their brother and or sister children and stepparents in study focusing on the adult stepchild perceptions of communication in the stepchild stepparent relationship three contradictions were found to be experienced by the stepchildren participants dialectics of emotional distance closeness while many stepchildren expressed feelings of emotional distance the participants had varying reasons for keeping the distance some participants who still had positive relationship with their nonresidential parent kept an emotional distance from their stepparent as an act of loyalty that they felt toward their nonresidential parent other participants equated emotional distance to the fact that they had little in common with their stepparent however many participants expressed feeling some closeness with stepparent while maintaining an amount of emotional distance participants reported that they upheld relationship with the stepparent that contained honesty respect and trust yet they kept an emotional distance by continuing to address the stepparent by his her first name or simply claiming that each individual was very different from the other causing tension in an effort to promote emotional closeness stepparent status many of the stepchildren in the study also experienced dialectical tension between desiring for the family authority position to be designated to their one residential parent along with desire for both the residential parent and the stepparent to share parenting authority many participants felt that legitimating their stepparent as parent would result in the formation of closeness expression the participants expressed desire for open communication with their stepparent while at the same time expressing resistance to openness and instead favoring more careful form of communication due to the fact that the participants often sensed lack of familiarity with their stepparent in another study researchers aimed to identify the contradictions that were perceived by stepchildren when characterizing the ways that familial interactions caused them to feel caught in the middle between parents the participants expressed that they wanted to be centered in the family while at the same time they hoped to avoid being caught in the middle of two opposing parents the main contradiction identified in the study was similar to the autonomy connection dialectic stepchildren desired the freedom to communicate and enact the desired relationship with their parents however these stepchildren also felt the need to manage the constraints that resulted from parental communication particularly when both parents did not cooperate with one another while the stepchildren wanted to know what was happening at the same time they also wanted to be protected resulting in second dialectic of control restraint through this study the researchers believe that openness closeness dialectic between parents and their children is important to building functional stepfamily relationships one study focused on the relationship and communication between college aged stepchildren and their nonresidential parents found two underlying contradictions parenting and not parenting and openness and closeness many participants expressed that they wanted their nonresidential parent to be actively involved in parenting them but did not desire it once they were participants also expressed that while they wanted open and intimate communication with their nonresidential parents they felt that they could not closely communicate because of the nonresidential parent lack of familiarity with the child everyday life theory applications end of life care relational dialectics theory can be applied to the context of health care specifically end of life care providing system for caregiver communication that contains tensions and challenges the quality of the end of life journey is influenced by how these tensions are managed relational dialectics theory is an applicable framework for investigating the ongoing communication between physicians and their patients family members during the process of end of life care when making choices about end of life medical care family members friends or surrogate decision makers often experience feelings of tension and burden decision makers must deal with the relational and moral tensions that come with such decision making family members in charge of making end of life decisions often face conflicting emotions between holding on and letting go recognizing the need to let patient go while wanting to continue fighting to keep loved one alive in study that focused on the communication tensions perceived among the maori culture during the end of life journey it was found that despite the culture focus on collectivism and its emphasis on harmony four communication tensions existed between caregivers family and friends and patients autonomy and connection conflict and connection isolation and connection and balancing the needs of self and other grief the human grieving process is marked by relational dialectics after the death of child bereaved parents often experience tension between presence and absence by grieving their child permanent absence while still experiencing an emotional bond toward the deceased child bereaved parents may also experience tension between openness and closeness where they desire to discuss their feelings with friends or family yet they are hesitant to share because of the potentially negative reactions they could receive one study aimed at focusing on how families make sense of contradictory discourses found two discursive contradictions family members wishes vs patient wishes and emotionality vs rationality through interviews with participants who had experienced the loss of loved one researchers concluded that many of the end of life decisions made by family members patients and doctors were centered on making sense of the simultaneous desires to hold on and to let go participants recognized that they experienced tension between their own preferences and the preferences of loved one and with that experienced the tension between desiring to make decisions based on emotions versus making decisions based on rationality dialectical contradictions have also been found among parents who have lost child one study found that two primary dialectical contradictions occurred for parents who had experienced the death of child openness closeness and presence absence parents experienced openness closeness when they desired to talk about their child and their loss yet they perceived the outcome as risky especially if they sensed that friends and family wished for the parents to move on participants explained that they were able to manage this contradiction by being selective with their disclosure and taking control over the communicative situation when dealing with the presence absence dialectic bereaved parents experienced tensions between the ongoing bond that they experienced with their child and the physical absence of the child participants expressed that when people were not willing to remember their dead child the physical absence of the child was deeply felt however when people chose to remember the deceased child the parent experienced feelings of comfort and continual bonding with the child dialogue dialogue is typically conversation between two or more people these conversations are what constitute relationships as communication is the very foundation of any relationship according to cools the four important concepts that form the foundation of dialogism the self and the other situated in contradictory forces the chronotope and the carnivalesque and heteroglossia and utterance similarity in dialogue the following components are the most important constitutive dialogue utterance chains dialectical flux aesthetic moment and critical sensibility constitutive dialogue while some theorists along with baxter may argue that communication is simply feature in relationship examining constitutive dialogue suggests that communication is actually what creates and maintains relationship instead according to baxter constitutive approach to communication asks how communication defines or constructs the social world including our selves and our personal relationships from constitutive perspective then persons and relationships are not analytically separable from communication instead communication constitutes these phenomena when initial researchers studied relationships they found that similarities backgrounds and interests are usually what hold people together while self disclosure is the root of these components dialogic researchers would argue that differences are just as important as similarities and they are both discovered through dialogue utterance chains to understand utterance chains we must know that an utterance is what person says in one turn of conversation when utterances are linked to competing discourses they are considered utterance chains baxter believes that there are four links on the chain where the struggle of competing discourses can be heard these are cultural ideologies relational history non yet spoken response of partner or utterance and normative evaluation of third party to utterance baxter also suggest that to understand an utterance we must also understand the discourse she posits in the broadest sense discourse is cultural system of meaning that circulates among group members and which makes our talk sensical for example in the united states the discourse of individualism helps us to understand and value an utterance such as need to find myself first before commit to serious relationship with another person dialectical flux dialectical flux is the unpredictable unfinalizable indeterminate nature of personal relationships relationships are complicated and intertwined with dialectical tensions spiraling inversion and segmentation are two strategies that baxter and montgomery have established to respond to this complexity spiraling inversion is generally no win situation struggle between two different thought processes for example if you were to do something your parents did not approve of you could lie about it but your parents might yell at you for lying and on the other hand you could tell them upfront and they could be completely quiet in shock segmentation is pertaining to more than one role in relationship that must be altered depending on the situation for example if you were working at your father shop as part time job he would be considered your father and your boss this could mean that he has different expectations of you in different circumstances and his attitude towards you might change between roles aesthetic moment aesthetic moments are brief incidents in relationship that bring participants together through the use of dialogue there is temporary feeling of wholeness felt between partners involved in this dialogue it is easy to see examples of aesthetic moments in romantic relationships such as first kiss or reciting of wedding vows but these moments can be experienced by anyone critical sensibility according to griffin critical sensibility is an obligation to critique dominant voices especially those that suppress opposing viewpoints responsibility to advocate for those who are muted this means that both sides of dialogue are equal to one another no one person is more powerful or dominant than the other and they are able to communicate without these imbalances interfering this does not mean that the dialogue is free of competing discourses as listed in utterance chains ethics when communicating we must understand that morals do not apply for all people sometimes lying can be entirely minor in communication but there are oftentimes that lying can majorly affect the perspective of those being lied to there are several times where most people would justify white lie or lie that causes no harm for instance if your mother was in the hospital you could tell her she still looked beautiful even if her appearance was far from it because it would make her feel better other actions that are only followed through based on whether they have positive or negative outcome are called consequential ethics according to sissela bok lies drag around an initial negative weight that must be factored into ethical equations bok believes in the principle of veracity which says that truthful statements are preferable to lies in the absence of special circumstances that overcome the negative weight critiques according to theorist leslie baxter there are three major limitations in the work of relational dialectics theory baxter claims that her work has been too distanced from naturally occurring talk between relating parties and claims that the theory needs firmer empirical base when applied to talk between relating parties baxter also believes that more future work needs to include multiple voices instead of focusing on the more popular research on the dialectics between two voices lastly baxter has stated that future research should focus on discourse through time such as studying dialogue and how it transforms over longer period of time see also dialogic mikhail bakhtin uncertainty reduction theory references adler ronald

      "the oboe concerto in minor is an early th century concerto for oboe strings and continuo attributed to the venetian composer alessandro marcello the earliest extant manuscript containing johann sebastian bach solo keyboard arrangement of the concerto bwv dates from around as concerto for oboe strings and continuo its oldest extant sources date from that year it was printed in amsterdam and minor variant of the concerto was written down bach keyboard version was published as an arrangement of concerto by antonio vivaldi in the th century in the minor version of the oboe concerto was published as composition by benedetto marcello alessandro brother in the second half of the th century several publications indicated alessandro again as the composer of the piece as it had been in its early th century print and the oboe concerto was again published in its minor version as well oboe concerto versions and versions based on bach arrangement kept repertoire in the th and st century history the concerto in minor was published by jeanne roger in amsterdam in as concerto cinque concerto in five parts for oboe soloist strings two violin and one viola parts and continuo composed by alessandro marcello no publication date appears in the print although the year of publication is depending on author sometimes given as ca or it can be inferred from the consecutive testaments of the publisher father estienne roger and from the sequence of publication numbers the publication presents the melody lines unadorned that is it is left to the performing musician to embellish melodies with ornaments such as trills mordents and grace notes alessandro marcello published most of his works under pseudonym eterio stinfalico the oboe concerto publication was an exception in that sense as it used his real name in his weimar period johann sebastian bach arranged several concertos by venetian composers most of them by antonio vivaldi for solo keyboard in july prince johann ernst returned to weimar from the netherlands with several compositions by italian masters vivaldi op estro armonico had been published in amsterdam in and there is little doubt that the prince brought this edition containing twelve concertos to weimar in as bach apparently used this print for five of his solo keyboard arrangements the prince who also composed italianate concertos presumably encouraged bach to produce solo keyboard arrangements of such works as the prince left weimar in july it is estimated that most of bach solo keyboard arrangements of italian and italianate concertos originated in the period from july to july that is at least those arrangements that could be performed on harpsichord without pedalboard while the weimar court organ which would be needed for arrangements including pedals such as bwv would have been unavailable for undergoing repairs in this period bach manualiter arrangement bwv of the marcello concerto was apparently not based on the amsterdam edition but must have been based on lost manuscript version of the concerto that circulated before it was printed the july to july timeframe may fit for the production of the arrangement of this concerto although an earlier or later date is possible too bach autograph of the solo keyboard arrangement is lost but the arrangement was copied around by bach second cousin johann bernhard as the third item in manuscript containing of johann sebastian keyboard transcriptions of italian and italianate concertos in johann bernhard son johann ernst wrote title page for this collection suggesting that the collection contained vivaldi arrangements for organ exclusively he may have intended this title page for the first concerto in the collection only which was indeed an arrangement of vivaldi concerto but an unknown hand later added the number xii before the title thus causing the that all were vivaldi arrangements another copy of bach arrangement indicates marcello without first name as the composer of the original work and bach as the arranger that copy specifying harpsichord as the intended instrument for the arrangement originated after johann bernhard but may have been copied from an earlier stage of bach arrangement another manuscript containing bach arrangement of marcello oboe concerto indicated as composer on the title page without mentioning an earlier model or its composer for the composition wilhelm friedemann the ornamentation as indicated in bach keyboard version of the concerto works well on harpsichord but is less suitable for performance on an early th century oboe nonetheless bach ornamentation has been used for th century publications of the oboe concerto the ornamentation causes fewer problems when performed on modern oboe editions of the minor version of the oboe concerto with an ornamentation which is better in line with the possibilities of baroque oboe have been proposed since the late th century another transcription of the concerto as concerto for oboe strings and continuo in minor is found in manuscript the type of errors in this manuscript seems to suggest that the transposition from minor to minor may have been produced by its scribes while copying this manuscript writes the composer name as marcello without specifying first name as alessandro brother benedetto was far better known as composer by the name marcello later generations would interpret the title of the manuscript as referring to the better known of the marcello composers movements the piece has three movements andante spiccato adagio presto the concerto survives in

      "is an important scottish delict case decided by the house of lords on causation the case is also influential in negligence in the english law of tort even though english law does not recognise allurement per se the case main significance is that after the shift within the common law of negligence from strict liability to reasonable standard of care this case advocated middle way namely even if the loss or harm is not itself foreseeable liability may arise provided the actual loss falls with foreseeable class of harm this idea was neither developed nor expanded upon and only one year later the claimant in doughty turner manufacturing obtained no remedy via this middle way however the case was followed in subsequent cases on occupiers liability facts one evening in november two boys aged and were walking down russell road edinburgh where some post office workers were repairing cables under the street the men had opened manhole and had erected weather tent over it with an access ladder inside from mid afternoon onwards the tent had four red paraffin warning lamps the workmen left around pm for tea break nearby before leaving they withdrew the ladder leaving it outside the tent while the workmen were out the boys arrived and started meddling with the equipment they picked up one of the lamps and entered the tent they took the ladder and proceeded to explore the manhole after which they safely climbed out again the younger boy tripped over the lamp which fell into the manhole and broke the paraffin leaked and vaporised causing an explosion with flames reaching up to thirty feet the impact of the blast caused the year old to fall into the hole and suffer severe burn injuries the question arose whether the post office workers had been negligent in leaving the site unattended with the lamps burning under scots law they owed duty of reasonable care to prevent the site becoming an allurement for the boys had they discharged this duty on the other hand the children were trespasser and possibly contributorily negligence crucial issue was the likelihood or foreseeability of the presence of children on russell road and whether the explosion causing the serious burn injuries was of different type than that could have been foreseeable the court of first instance the first division of the court of session limited the liability of the post office on the grounds that although the danger to children was foreseeable the accident itself was not foreseeable the defence had argued that the boys were not only trespassers but also contributorily negligeny but the court responded that the post office did not have any exclusive interest in the middle of the road to support claim of trespass and taking into consideration the youth of the boy it was agreed that he was not contributorily negligence and these points were dropped on appeal to the house of lords judgment on appeal lord jenkins addressed the duty of issue of care established by lord atkin in donoghue stevenson saying the post office had brought on the public highway apparatus capable of constituting source of danger to passer by it was therefore their duty that such passerby neighbour in the language of donoghue stevenson were so far as reasonably practicable protected from the various obstacles or allurements which the workmen had brought to the site it is clear that the safety precautions taken by the post office did not in this instance measure up to lord atkin test lord morris stated that exercising an ordinary and certainly not an over exacting degree of prevention the workmen should have decided when the tea break came that someone had better be left in charge who could repel the intrusion of inquisitive children thereby casting doubt that the workers had discharged their duty of care in both the first division and in the house of lords the defence argued that it was unforeseeable that children might be on russell road quiet road some four hundred yards away from any houses lord morris opined following the judgement of lord ordinary that if of course there was no likelihood that children might appear different considerations would apply but children did appear and find no reason to differ from the conclusion of the lord ordinary that the presence of children in the immediate vicinity of the shelter was reasonably to be anticipated lord guest declared that the burden of proof that the presence of children lay with the respondent and on the facts there was insufficient evidence to do this lord guest accepted that it was reasonable to anticipate the danger that might arise by meddling children and that that the normal dangers of such children falling into the manhole and injured by lamp were such that reasonable man would not have ignored them it was accepted that the explosion causing the burns was result of paraffin leaking from the lamp according to lord reid the boy injuries from burns was foreseeable although the extent of the injury of burn was greater than might have been expected this was no defence however if the injury were of different kind than the foreseeable type the defender might have escaped liability lord reid continued that as the cause of the accident the explosion from paraffin lamp was known it left no scope to allege the accident was caused from some unknown source rather than the fault of respondent lord reid concluded that the accident in question was but variant of foreseeable and it mattered not it may have arisen in an unforeseeable manner lord jenkins agreed finding no justification to hold someone liable if the accident had occurred from the burning of lamp but not if the lamp had exploded lord morris agreed saying that the injury suffered by the boy was of higher degree but was of the kind or type of accident which was foreseeable he said the respondent should not escape liability just because they could not foresee the exact way in which the boy might play with the equipment or the way in which he might get hurt allowing the appeal lord morris said there was duty owed by the respondent to safeguard the boy against the type or kind of occurrence which in fact happened and which resulted in his injuries and the defenders are not absolved from liability because they didn envisage the precise concatenation of circumstances which lead up to the accident lord guest pointed out that for making coherent chain of causation it is not necessary to follow the minute details leading up to the accident to be reasonably foreseeable but only that the type of accident caused was of foreseeable type he was of the view that the lower courts wrongly gave more emphasis on the fact on explosion to lord guest it was non essential element he gave more emphasis on the fact whether burning of paraffin outside the lamp was reasonable foreseeable event the lower courts had already concluded these events as reasonable foreseeable event but they were of the view the explosion was an unforeseeable event lord guest argued this as fallacious claim lord guest concluded that the accident and the injuries sustained by the boys should have been reasonably foreseen by post office employees who were in breach of duty to take adequate protection against the accident lord pearce cited the case of the wagon mound which held that person is not liable if the accident is of different type than the type which was foreseen by the person it would be unjust to check each and every details of the foreseeability test too minutely when the case deals with things that can be allurement to children leads to an accident and hard to foresee the exact way in which the accident may take place in sum all the judges allowed the boy

river village with the east west trail connecting la pointe via namekaawa iganing gordon with gaa hinckley history pre dakota before the arrival of the dakota sioux the area about lake lena was inhabited by the cheyenne fox and ho chunk with migratory gros ventre mandwe and menominee peoples the lake lena area served as place abundant with food in the heart of the folle avoine region with wild rice and sturgeon in addition the lake lena village was located along the site of the annual bear migratory path dakota with the arrival of the dakota sioux only the fox remained as permanent residents of the region however occasional cheyenne ho chunk and menominee peoples still came to the area for the wild rice the santee sioux maintained trade network routes offered by the st croix river and the series of trails connecting the lake lena village with lake superior mississippi river headwaters and other major upper mississippi river destinations red cedar river and chippewa river with the arrival of the ojibwe from the cultural center in la pointe the area about the upper st croix river became contested place though the fox were permanently pushed out of the area the dakota and ojibwe eventually came to peace and lived side by side ojibwe after the ojibwe had gained control of the upper st croix river valley the lake lena area became one of many network of trade villages however in the first treaty of prairie du chien the united states formally drew the boundaries separating the dakota and the ojibwe for the lake lena and other ojibwe already intertwined with the dakota this posed problem with agreements the more southern dakota north of the prairie du chien line moved south of the line with the more northern dakota north of the line were adopted as ojibwe and became the wolf totem meanwhile many of the ojibwe located south of the line were adopted into the mdewakanton by maintaining the trade network but with different tribal association aazhoomog transitioned from dakota ojibwe village to fully ojibwe village the ojibwe of the upper st croix river valley became one of the signatories to the treaty of st peters and the treaty of la pointe the treaty dubbed the white pine treaty brought an influx of lumber industry after the sandy lake tragedy the united states encouraged the consolidation of the ojibwe onto indian reservations rather than removing them west of the mississippi river in the treaty negotiations for the treaty of la pointe st croix chippewa realized that central reservation would be created immediately south of the upper st croix lake near solon springs wisconsin due to strong lumber interests the ojibwe knew the removal to reservation would mean eventual loss of hunting fishing and gathering rights promised the and treaties upon this realization the st croix chippewa refuted all provisions of the treaty negotiations and did not sign the treaty however by not signing the treaty the st croix chippewa lost their federal recognition however even as un recognized indian tribe the st croix chippewa was still eligible to receive their annuities depending on the time and location peoples of st croix chippewa went to either the mille lacs indian reservation or to the lac courte oreilles indian reservation eventually the lake lena village through the lumber operations in the region went to the mille lacs indian reservation more often than to the lac courte oreilles indian reservation mille lacs band of ojibwe after the loss of federal recognition of the st croix chippewa the population of the aazhoomog slowly declined for their annuity payment the people of aazhoomog were sent to either the lake mille lacs indian reservation or the lac courte oreilles indian reservation eventually the aazhoomog village through the lumber operations in the region went to the mille lacs indian reservation more often than to the lac courte oreilles indian reservation aazhoomog english name lake lena came about during this time named after mrs lena thayer who operated post office until the early beginning in under the authority of the consolidated chippewa agency lake lena village began receiving services independent of the mille lacs indians or the lac courte oreilles band of lake superior chippewa indians in when minnesota chippewa tribe was created under the indian reorganization act of the ojibwe was further divided between those located in minnesota and those located in wisconsin when the contemporary mille lacs band of ojibwe was organized its charter included the mille lacs indians sandy

      "hurricane michael of the atlantic hurricane season caused moderate damage in atlantic canada the seventeenth tropical cyclone thirteenth named storm and eighth hurricane of the season michael developed from non tropical system to the southwest of bermuda on october the system was initially subtropical but rapidly acquired tropical characteristics by october michael quickly strengthened into hurricane later that day by october michael peaked as category hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane wind scale at relatively high altitude of the storm weakened slightly to category hurricane and became extratropical shortly before making landfall in newfoundland on october as the intensity of michael was equivalent to category hurricane during landfall high winds were reported throughout atlantic canada especially in newfoundland winds from the storm peaked at in st lawrence newfoundland other locations across the island reported winds of high winds caused minor structure damage across newfoundland confined to vinyl siding peeled off shattered windows and unroofed houses in addition sporadic power outages were also reported from corner brook to st john michael also dropped rainfall across atlantic canada and in maine the rainfall was generally light with much of the region reporting between of precipitation michael also produced high tides accompanied by waves reported as high as by buoy well offshore of newfoundland meteorological history the system originated out of non tropical cold core upper level low that drifted southward into the subtropics the low interacted with cold front which resulted in the development of stationary front over the bahamas on october as the cold low drifted southward surface low developed on october the surface low remained mostly stationary until early on october as it merged with the upper level low and deepened while north of the bahamas and east of the coast of florida later that day the system gained enough tropical characteristics and became organized enough to be classified as subtropical depression the storm remained stationary over warm water with sea surface temperatures around while it continued to gain additional tropical characteristics around utc on october it strengthened into subtropical storm after satellite classifications showed stronger storm later that day the cyclone continued to develop as more thunderstorms formed and persisted near the low level circulation hurricane michael intensifying over the alt hurricane moving over the warm waters of the gulf stream by utc on october the transition was completed and michael was reclassified as tropical storm as supported by satellite classifications via the dvorak technique shortly thereafter the national hurricane center initiated

continued to organize that afternoon michael rapidly intensified further and was upgraded to hurricane as reconnaissance flights found winds of at that point michael began to move northward while michael was maintaining minimal hurricane status the eye remained ragged yet well defined early on october michael briefly strengthened to km mph before weakening slightly six hours later tracking into cooler water michael began its extratropical transition while accelerating to the northeast towards newfoundland which prevented significant weakening the acceleration was caused by shortwave trough embedded within strong southwesterly mid level flow unexpectedly michael began to rapidly intensify on october while in extratropical transition later that day ship report in the eastern eyewall reported minimum central pressure of and maximum sustained winds of km mph making michael category hurricane on the saffir simpson hurricane scale the sudden intensification was determined to have been as result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over sea surface temperatures around michael formed hybrid system combining influences of hurricane with that of powerful extratropical cyclone at utc on october michael made landfall near parsons harbour newfoundland with winds of km mph shortly thereafter michael transitioned into an extratropical storm the extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across newfoundland on october and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough the storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of newfoundland that afternoon impact rain accumulations with michael because it

non space character in column indicates that this line is continuation of the previous line in column indicates that this entire line is comment columns though may contain number which serves as label columns though are ignored and may be used for comments in the days of punched cards these columns often contained sequence number so that the deck of cards could be sorted into the correct order if someone accidentally dropped the cards fortran removed the need for the indentation rule and added inline comments using the character as the comment delimiter cobol in fixed format code line indentation is significant columns and columns from onwards are ignored if or is in column then that line is comment until cobol if or was in column it would define debugging line which would be ignored unless the compiler was instructed to compile it cobra cobra supports block comments with which is like the often found in based languages but with two differences the character is reused from the single line comment form and the block comments can be nested which is convenient for commenting out large blocks of code curl curl supports block comments with user defined tags as in foo foo lua like raw strings there can be any number of equals signs between the square brackets provided both the opening and closing tags have matching number of equals signs this allows nesting as long as nested block comments raw strings use different number of equals signs than their enclosing comment comment nested comment lua discards the first newline if present that directly follows the opening tag perl block comments in perl are considered part of the documentation and are given the name plain old documentation pod technically perl does not have convention for including block comments in source code but pod is routinely used as workaround this has been addressed in perl which uses to denote block comments perl actually allows the use of any right and left paired brackets after and even the more complicated are all valid block comments brackets are also allowed to be nested inside comments goes to the last closing brace php php supports standard style comments but supports perl style as well python the use of the triple double quotes although sometimes used to comment out lines of source does not actually form comment the enclosed text becomes string usually string statement python usually ignores lone string as statement except when string is the first statement in the body of module class or function see docstring ruby as with python and perl ruby has no specific block comment syntax however like perl documentation blocks can be used as block comments as they are ignored by the interpreter lang the region of lines enclosed by the and delimiters are ignored by the interpreter the tag name can be any sequence of alphanumeric characters that may be used to indicate how the enclosed block is to be deciphered for example could indicate the start of block of latex formatted documentation scheme and racket the next complete syntactic component expression can be commented out with abap abap supports two different kinds of comments if the first character of line including indentation is an asterisk the whole line is considered as comment while single double quote begins an in line commet which acts until the end of the line abap comments are not possible

      "human science studies the philosophical biological social and cultural aspects of human life human sciences aims to expand our understanding of the human world through broad approach it encompasses wide range of fields including history philosophy genetics sociology psychology evolutionary biology biochemistry neurosciences and anthropology it is the study and interpretation of the experiences activities constructs and artifacts associated with human beings the study of the human sciences attempts to expand and enlighten the human being knowledge of their existence its with other species and systems and the development of artifacts to perpetuate the human expression and thought it is the study of human phenomena the study of the human experience is historical and current in nature it requires the evaluation and interpretation of the historic human experience and the analysis of current human activity to gain an understanding of human phenomena and to project the outlines of human evolution human science is the objective informed critique of human existence and how it relates to reality meaning of science ambiguity and confusion regarding usage of the terms science empirical science and scientific method have complicated the usage of the term human science with respect to human activities the term science is derived from the latin scientia meaning knowledge science may be appropriately used to refer to any branch of knowledge or study dealing with body of facts or truths systematically arranged to show the operation of general laws however according to positivists the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge which comes from positive affirmation of theories through strict scientific method the application of knowledge or mathematics as result of the positivist influence the term science is frequently employed as synonym for empirical science empirical science is knowledge based on the scientific method systematic approach to verification of knowledge first developed for dealing with natural physical phenomena and emphasizing the importance of experience based on sensory observation however even with regard to the natural sciences significant difference exist among scientists and philosophers of science with regard to what constitutes valid scientific method for example evolutionary biology geology and astronomy studying events that cannot be repeated can use method of historical narratives more recently usage of the term has been extended to the study of human social phenomena thus natural and social sciences are commonly classified as science whereas the study of classics languages literature music philosophy history religion and the visual and performing arts are referred to as the humanities ambiguity with respect to the meaning of the term science is aggravated by the widespread use of the term formal science with reference to any one of several sciences that is predominantly concerned with abstract form that cannot be validated by physical experience through the senses such as logic mathematics and the theoretical branches of computer science information theory and statistics history human science also humanistic social science moral science and human sciences refers to the investigation of human life and activities via an framework spanning the sciences and humanities underlying human science is the relationship between various humanistic modes of inquiry within fields such as history sociology anthropology and economics and advances in such things as genetics evolutionary biology and the social sciences for the purpose of understanding our lives in rapidly changing world its use of an empirical methodology that encompasses psychological experience contrasts to the purely positivistic approach typical of the natural sciences which exclude all methods not based solely on sensory observations modern approaches in the human sciences integrate an understanding of human structure function and adaptation with broader exploration of what it means to be human the term is also used to distinguish not only the content of field of study from those of the natural sciences but also its methodology early development the term moral science was used by david hume in his enquiry concerning the principles of morals to refer to the systematic study of human nature and relationships hume wished to establish science of human nature based upon empirical phenomena and excluding all that does not arise from observation rejecting teleological theological and metaphysical explanations hume sought to develop an essentially descriptive methodology phenomena were to be precisely characterized he emphasized the necessity of carefully explicating the cognitive content of ideas and vocabulary relating these to their empirical roots and real world significance variety of early thinkers in the humanistic sciences took up hume direction adam smith for example conceived of economics as moral science in the humean sense later development partly in reaction to the establishment of positivist philosophy and the latter comtean intrusions into traditionally humanistic areas such as sociology non postivistic researchers in the humanistic sciences began to carefully but emphatically distinguish the methodological approach appropriate to these areas of study for which the unique and distinguishing characteristics of phenomena are in the forefront for the biographer from that appropriate to the natural sciences for which the ability to link phenomena into generalized groups is foremost in this sense johann gustav droysen contrasted the humanistic science need to comprehend the phenomena under consideration with natural science need to explain phenomena while windelband coined the terms idiographic for descriptive study of the individual nature of phenomena and nomothetic for sciences that aim to define the generalizing laws wilhelm dilthey brought nineteenth century attempts to formulate methodology appropriate to the humanistic sciences together with hume term moral science which he translated as term with no exact english equivalent dilthey attempted to articulate the entire range of the moral sciences in comprehensive and systematic way meanwhile his conception of encompasses also the abovementioned study of classics languages literature music philosophy history religion and the visual and performing arts he characterized the scientific nature of study as depending upon the conviction that perception gives access to reality the self evident nature of logical reasoning the principle of sufficient reason but the specific nature of the is based on the inner experience erleben the comprehension verstehen of the meaning of expressions and understanding in terms of the relations of the part and the whole in contrast to the the explanation of phenomena by hypothetical laws in the natural sciences edmund husserl student of franz brentano articulated his philosophy in way that could be thought as basis of dilthey attempt dilthey appreciated husserl logische untersuchungen the first draft of husserl phenomenology as an epoch making epistemological foundation of his conception of in recent years human science has been used to refer to philosophy and approach to science that seeks to understand human experience in deeply subjective personal historical contextual cross cultural political and spiritual terms human science is the science of qualities rather than of quantities and closes the subject object split in science in particular it addresses the ways in which self reflection art music poetry drama language and imagery reveal the human condition by being interpretive reflective and appreciative human science re opens the conversation among science art and philosophy objective vs subjective experiences since auguste comte the positivistic social sciences have sought to imitate the approach of the natural sciences by emphasizing the importance of objective external observations and searching for universal laws whose operation is predicated on external initial conditions that do not take into account differences in subjective human perception and attitude critics argue that subjective human experience and intention plays such central role in determining human social behavior that an objective approach to the social sciences is too confining rejecting the positivist influence they argue that the scientific method can rightly be applied to subjective as well as objective experience the term subjective is used in this context to refer to inner psychological experience rather than outer sensory experience it is not used in the sense of being prejudiced by personal motives or beliefs human sciences in universities the human sciences degree is relatively young it has been degree subject at oxford since and at ucl was proposed in by professor young and implemented two years later his aim was to train general science graduates who would be scientifically literate numerate and easily able to communicate across wide range of disciplines replacing the traditional classics training for higher level government and management careers central topics include the evolution of humans their behaviour molecular and population genetics population growth and ageing ethnic and cultural diversity and the human interaction with the environment including conservation disease and nutrition the study of both biological and social disciplines integrated within framework of human diversity and sustainability should enable the human scientist to develop professional competencies suited to address such human problems in the united kingdom human sciences is

      "sk channels small conductance calcium activated potassium channels are subfamily of ca activated channels they are so called because of their small single channel conductance in the order of ps sk channels are type of ion channel allowing potassium cations to cross the cell membrane and are activated opened by an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium through type calcium channels their activation limits the firing frequency of action potentials and is important for regulating in the neurons of the central nervous system as well as many other types of electrically excitable cells this is accomplished through the hyperpolarizing leak of positively charged potassium ions along their concentration gradient into the extracellular space this causes the membrane potential to become more negative sk channels are thought to be involved in synaptic plasticity and therefore play important roles in learning and memory function sk channels are expressed throughout the central nervous system they are highly conserved in mammals as well as in other organisms such as drosophila melanogaster and caenorhabditis elegans sk channels are specifically involved in the medium potential mahp they affect both the intrinsic excitability of neurons and synaptic transmission they are also involved in calcium signaling sk channels control action potential discharge frequency in hippocampal neurons midbrain dopaminergic neurons dorsal vagal neurons sympathetic neurons nucleus reticularis thalmic neurons inferior olive neurons spinal and hypoglossal motoneurons mitrial cells in the olfactory bulb and cortical neurons structure sk potassium channels share the same basic architecture with shaker like voltage gated potassium channels four subunits associate to form tetramer each of the subunits has six transmembrane hydrophobic alpha helical domains loop between and called the loop provides the pore forming region that always faces the center of the channel each of the subunits has six hydrophobic alpha helical domains that insert into the cell membrane loop between the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains forms the potassium ion selectivity filter sk channels may assemble as homotetrameric channels or as channels consisting of more than one sk channel subtype in addition sk potassium channels are tightly associated with the protein calmodulin which accounts for the calcium sensitivity of these channels calmodulin participates as subunit of the channel itself bound to the cytoplasmic terminus region of the peptide called the calmodulin binding domain cambd additional association of the phosphorylating kinase ck and phosphatase pp on the cytoplasmic face of the protein allow for enriched ca sensitivity and thus kinetics modulation ck serves to phosphorylate the skca bound cam at the residue rather than the channel helices themselves to reduce calcium sensitivity this may only be accomplished when the channel pore is closed pp this residue upon ck inhibition the selectivity filter of all sk channel subtypes whether sk sk sk or sk is highly conserved and reflects the selectivity seen in any potassium channel gygd amino acid residue sequence on the pore forming loop these channels are considered to be voltage independent as they possess only two of seven positively charged amino acid residues that are typically seen in prototypical voltage gated potassium channel classification the sk channel family contains members sk sk sk and sk sk is often referred to as ik intermediate conductance due to its higher conductance ps channel gene aliases associated subunits sk kca calmodulin pp ck sk kca calmodulin pp ck sk kca calmodulin pp ck sk kca calmodulin pp ck gating mechanism the sk channel gating mechanism is controlled by intracellular calcium levels calcium enters the cell via voltage activated calcium channels as well as through nmda receptors calcium does not directly bind to the sk channel calcium binds to the protein calmodulin cam when bound to calcium cam binds to the cam binding domain on the intracellular subunit of the sk channel when each of the four cam binding domain subunits is bound to calmodulin the sk channel changes conformation this transitions the channel from tetramer of monomers to folded dimer of dimers which results in rotation of the cam binding domains this rotation causes the mechanical opening of the channel gate the time constant of sk channel activation is approximately ms when calcium levels are depleted the time constant for channel deactivation ranges from ms blockers all sk channels can be blocked by quaternary ammonium salts of plant derived neurotoxin bicuculline in addition sk channels sk sk but not sk ik are sensitive to blockade by the bee toxin apamin and the scorpion venoms tamapin and charybdotoxin chtx all via competitive antagonism for access to the mouth of the pore formation all known blockers compete for roughly the same binding site the pore in all subtypes this provides physical blockage to the channel pore since all blockers are universal to all three types of sk channels there is an incredibly narrow therapeutic window that does not allow for blocking of specific sk channel subtype quaternary ammonium salts like bicuculline and tea enter the pore via the selectivity filter by acting as potassium mimic in the dehydration step of pore permeation the following molecules are other toxins and organic compounds that also inhibit all three small sk channel subtypes to any even minimal degree dequalinium tubocurarine ucl ucl cyproheptadine fluoxetine the active ingredient in prozac ns scyllatoxin leiurotoxin lei dab methyl laudanosine me bicuculline pancuronium atracurium ethyl benzodimidazol on dichloro hydroxyimino indolin one cyclohexyl dimethyl pyrazol yl methylpyrimidin amine yl benzodimidazol amine modulators allosteric modulators of small sk channels work by changing the apparent calcium sensitivity of the channels examples include non selective positive modulators of sk channels ebio thyl enzim dazolin ne ns dichloro indole dione oxime sk and sk selective positive modulators cyppa ns cy clohexyl dimethyl yrazol yl methyl yrimidin yl mine chemical structure of sk ion channel modulators synaptic plasticity and long term potentiation in dendritic spines sk channels are directly coupled to nmda receptors in addition to being activated by calcium flow through voltage gated calcium channels sk channels can be activated by calcium flowing through nmda receptors which occurs after depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane experiments using apamin have shown that specifically blocking sk channels can increase learning and long term potentiation in addition brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf causes the down regulation of sk channels which facilitates long term potentiation increasing sk channel activity has the opposite effect and serves to impair learning an increase in sk channel activity that occurs over time may be related to decreases in plasticity and memory that is seen with aging role in parkinson disease the dysfunction of potassium channels including sk channels is thought to play role in the pathogenesis of parkinson disease pd progressive disorder sk channel blockers control the firing rate the number of action potentials produced by neuron in given time and the firing pattern the way action potentials are allocated throughout time through their production of ahp sk channel activators decrease the firing rate and neuron sensitivity to excitatory stimuli whereas sk channel blockers increase the firing rate and sensitivity to excitatory stimuli this has important implications as to the function of dopaminergic neurons for example the amount of dopamine released by midbrain dopaminergic neurons is much higher when the frequency of firing increases than when they fire at constant rate sk channels are widely expressed in midbrain dopaminergic neurons multiple pharmacological techniques have been used to adjust sk affinity for calcium ions thereby modulating the excitability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons blockage of sk channels in vivo increases the firing rate of substantia nigra cells which increases the amount of dopamine released from the synaptic terminals when large amount of dopamine accumulates in the cytosol cell damage is induced due to the build up of free radicals and damage to mitochondria in addition techniques have been used to modulate sk channels in order to alter the dopamine phenotype of neurons after the loss of th tyrosine hydroxylase positive substantia nigra compacta snc neurons due to parkinson induced the number of these neurons can partially recover via cell phenotype shift from th tyrosine hydroxylase negative to th the number of th neurons can be altered by sk channel modulation to be specific the infusion of sk agonists into substantia nigra increases the number of th neurons whereas the infusion of sk antagonist decreases the number of th neurons the reason for this relationship between sk channels and th expression may be due to neuroprotection against dopamine toxicity based on the two opposing roles of sk channels in the pathogenesis of pd two contradictory methods have been suggested as therapeutic options for the improvement of pd symptoms inhibition of sk channels inhibition of sk channels to be specific the blockage of sk channels increases the frequency of firing in dopaminergic neurons thereby increasing the release of dopamine it is therefore thought that the application of sk channels blockers in pd patients may alleviate short term motor symptoms however inhibition also results in decreased number of th substantia nigra compacta snc neurons in the cell which results in decrease in dopamine synthesis over the long term facilitation of sk channels enhancing the function of sk channels increases the number of th substantia nigra compacta snc neurons in the cell thereby maintaining dopamine synthesis over the long term however the facilitation of sk channels decreases the firing frequency in dopaminergic neurons over the short term

      "east timorese independence referendum in south sudanese independence referendum in an independence referendum is type of referendum in which the citizens of territory decide whether the territory should become an independent sovereign state an independence referendum that results in vote for independence does not always ultimately result in independence the articles on specific referendums are linked with dates in the table on past referendums procedure an independence referendum typically arises first after political success for nationalists of territory this could come in the election of politicians or parties with separatist policies or from pressure from nationalist organisations negotiations negotiations for the terms of an independence referendum may take place between the nationalists and the government which exercises sovereignty over the territory if terms can be agreed then the independence referendum can be held with its result binding and respected by the international community independence referendums can be held without the consent of governments but their results are usually ignored by the international community various issues can be discussed in negotiations such as the date and timing of the poll as well as voter eligibility for these instances common electoral practice is often widely used although there can be deviations as seen with the lowering of the voting age for the scottish independence referendum other issues to be negotiated include what question or questions should be on the ballot and what the voting options could be independence referendums can offer options of greater autonomy as well as or instead of the status quo they can also put forward other constitutional questions to ballot the questions that referendums ask may be revised if parties involved in negotiations consider them to be too leading negotiations notably need to address what would make result binding for some independence referendums simple majority is required for one option in other cases quota can be used where certain percentage of the vote or the electorate needs to be in favour of an option for it to be binding donbass status referendum in was rejected as illegal by the ukrainian government successful negotiations can be hard to achieve for nationalists as governments can be reluctant to give up sovereignty for example nationalists planned to hold referendum in catalonia in but met opposition from the spanish government as result the referendum that went ahead was unofficial and non binding aftermath in the event of vote for independence there may be negotiations on the terms of secession for the territory from the sovereign state declaration of independence for new state is then made and international recognition can follow as well as membership of international organisations such as the united nations in cases involving non binding referendums this can lead to unilateral declaration of independence and therefore partially recognised or self proclaimed states in the event of vote against independence there may still be strong nationalist movement and calls for there to be rerun of the independence referendum for example after two referendums in quebec the parti québécois has continued to raise the prospect of holding another referendum and the scottish national party has said that there should be repeat of the referendum if the united kingdom leaves the european union past independence referendums proposed state year former state majority for independence independence

      "hamlet the first published text of hamlet is often described as bad quarto bad quarto in shakespearean scholarship is quarto sized publication of one of shakespeare plays that is considered spurious pirated from theatre without permission by someone in the audience writing it down as it was spoken or written down later by an actor or group of actors which according to theory has been termed memorial reconstruction since the quarto derives from performance and lacks direct link to the author original manuscript the text would be expected to contain corruptions abridgements and paraphrasings that is in contrast to good quarto which is considered to be text that is authorised one that may have been printed from the author manuscript or scribal copy or prompt copy that is based on the author manuscript bad quartos are considered to include the first quartos of romeo and juliet henry the merry wives of windsor and hamlet the concept has expanded to include quartos of plays by other elizabethan authors including peele the battle of alcazar greene orlando furioso and the collaborative script sir thomas more the theory has been accepted studied and expanded by many scholars but some scholars do not accept it and those such as eric sams consider the entire theory to be without foundation jonathan bate states that late twentieth and early twenty first century scholars have begun to question the whole edifice origins of bad quarto theory the concept of the bad quarto as category of text was created by bibliographer alfred pollard in his book shakespeare folios and quartos the idea came to him in his reading of the address by the editors john heminges and henry condell which appears at the beginning of shakespeare first folio and is titled to the great variety of readers heminges and condell refer to diuerse stolne and surreptitious copies of the plays it had been thought that that reference was generally to quarto editions of the plays pollard however claims that heminges and condell meant to refer only to bad quartos and pollard lists as bad the first quartos of romeo and juliet henry the merry wives of windsor hamlet and pericles pollard pointed out that not only the texts contained badness but also there was badness in those who pirated the plays scholar greg worked closely with pollard and published the bad quarto of the merry wives of windsor which is work that is significant in the history of the bad quarto theory greg described how the text may have been copied and he identified the actor who played the role of host as the culprit greg called the process that the actor may have used memorial reconstruction phrase later used by other scholars comparison of the to be or not to be soliloquy in the first three editions of hamlet for shakespeare the first folio of is the crucial document of the plays contained in that collection have no other source the other plays had been printed in quarto form at least once between and but since the prefatory matter in the first folio itself warns against earlier texts which are termed stol and surreptitious copies maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors th and th century editors of shakespeare tended to ignore the quarto texts and preferred the folio it was at first suspected that the bad quarto texts represented shorthand reporting practice mentioned by thomas heywood in the prologue to his play if you know not me you know nobody reporters would surreptitiously take down play text in shorthand during performance and pirate popular play for competing interest greg and rhodes argued instead for an alternative theory since some of the minor speeches varied less than those of major characters their hypothesis was that the actors who played the minor roles had reconstructed the play texts from memory and gave an accurate report of the parts that they themselves had memorized and played but less correct report of the other actors parts the idea caught on among shakespeare scholars peter alexander added the first part of the contention betwixt the two famous houses of york and lancaster and the true tragedy of richard duke of york the earliest versions of henry vi part and henry vi part to the roster of bad quartos they had been previously thought to be source plays for shakespeare later versions of the same stories the concept of the bad quarto was extended to play texts by authors other than shakespeare and by the second half of the th century the idea was widely being used however by the end of the century considerable doubt had been cast on the concept of memorial reconstruction by the work of laurie maguire then at the university of ottawa criticism and alternative hypotheses some problems exist with the bad quarto hypothesis the first quarto of richard iii is considered bad quarto even though it is an unusually good bad quarto alexander himself recognised that the idea of memorial reconstruction did not apply perfectly to the two plays that he studied which possessed problematical features that could not be explained he maintained that the quartos of the two early histories were partial memorial reconstructions some critics including eric sams and hardin craig dispute the entire concept of memorial reconstruction by pointing out that unlike shorthand reporting no reliable historical evidence exists that actors reconstructed plays from memory they believe that memorial reconstruction is modern fiction individual scholars have sometimes preferred alternative explanations for variant texts such as revision steven urkowitz has argued the hypothesis that king lear is revised work in shakespeare revision of king lear some scholars have argued that the more challenging plays of the shakespearean canon like all well that ends well and troilus and cressida make sense as works that shakespeare wrote at one time and later revised steven roy miller considers revision hypothesis in preference to bad quarto hypothesis for the taming of shrew the alternative version of shakespeare the taming of the shrew robert burkhart study shakespeare bad quartos deliberate abridgements designed for performance by reduced cast provides another alternative to the hypothesis of bad quartos as memorial reconstruction other studies have questioned the orthodox view on bad quartos as in david farley hills work on romeo and juliet maguire study in laurie maguire of the department of english at the university of ottawa published study of the concept of memorial reconstruction based on the analysis of errors made by actors taking part in the bbc tv shakespeare series broadcast in the early she found that actors typically add drop or invert single words however the larger scale errors that would be expected if actors were attempting to piece together the plays some time after their performance failed to appear in all but few of the bad quartos the study however uncovered some circumstantial evidence for memorial reconstruction in the bad quartos of hamlet the merry wives of windsor and pericles according to maguire virtually all the bad quartos appear to be accurate renditions of original texts that merit our attention as valid texts in their own right of other playwrights though the bad quarto concept originated in reference to shakespearean texts scholars have also applied it to non shakespearean play texts of the english renaissance era in leo kirschbaum published census of bad quartos and included play texts maguire study examined shakespearean and non shakespearean editions that have been categorised as bad quartos including the first editions of arden of feversham the merry devil of edmonton and fair em plays of the shakespeare apocrypha plus george chapman the blind beggar of alexandria christopher marlowe doctor faustus and the massacre at paris part of heywood if you know not me you know nobody and beaumont

channel as part of the xl pack and in early video on demand content started to appear on the virgin media platform on august espn classic launched on upc ireland channel as part of the max package it broadcast range of archive sports coverage with large emphasis on football on february bt group agreed to acquire espn uk and ireland tv channels business consisting of espn and espn america the value of the deal was not disclosed but bt is understood to have paid low tens of millions espn classic which was not part of the bt deal ceased transmission on satellite across europe the middle east and africa at midnight on august programming much of the channel output was football this included action from the premier league fa cup matches european cup european cup winners cup and league cup finals and some england games espn classic also showed games from the fifa world cup following multi year deal to show classic fifa world cup matches from to though most coverage on the channel was from the colour era it had shown original black and white footage of european cup finals going back as far as significant proportion of the football action on espn classic was archive itv football coverage including matches covered by regional itv companies however much of the football seen on the channel was not shown with the original commentary instead many games especially the premier league and fa cup games tended to feature commentary dubbed on more recently by jon champion and paul dempsey or commentary by sky sports broadcasters such as martin tyler and alan parry which seemed to be from the international feed of the time similarly the footage from games where commentary was later added did not include original on screen captions with espn adding captions themselves some european cup finals also had new commentary dubbed on by tony jones the channel also showed some rugby union international matches including action from the rugby world cup as well as past matches from the rugby union premiership other sports featured included cricket espn produced vintage boxing matches the ultimate fighter and more recently action from american sports to complement the live american sports action which was broadcast on espn and espn america in addition to the programmes mentioned above espn classic had made variety of other programmes these included sports years as well as many football compilation programmes in addition to mark the th anniversary of espn the channel showed the espn films for series espn classic regularly repeated the sporting action that it showed on the channel with the same material often being shown time and time again some of the action especially espn produced programmes and series had been broadcast on the channel on dozens of different occasions bbc produced programming during the first three years of the channel sporting action from the bbc was featured extensively however this deal expired in mid and was seemingly not renewed as for the next eighteen months the channel did not feature any sport produced by the bbc therefore sports such as rugby league golf athletics darts and snooker were not shown on the channel nor were events such as domestic cricket prior to the year that the bbc lost the rights to show live cricket wimbledon tennis the olympic games and football coverage to which the bbc had the exclusive rights which had included showings of and editions of match of the day under the title of the dead good match with the opening and closing titles removed and some editions were truncated with only one of the matches covered in particular programme being shown one exception had been bbc produced coverage of rugby union five nations tournament shown during the six nations championship in march new deal between espn and the bbc was signed which provided espn classic with access to around hours of footage however this was far less than under the previous agreement which had given the channel access to around hours the new deal meant that previous espn produced programmes based on the bbc archive such as the darts series bellies and bullseyes were once again shown on the channel along with new programmes such as athletics series solid gold team gb and other one off programmes such as compilation of top grand nationals this new deal with bbc sport coincided with new look for the channel the first new look since espn uk launched in summer live action espn classic occasionally showed live action when two events to which espn has the rights took place at the same time the first live sport that the channel showed was two uefa europa league matches on september and october the first of the two games was maribor and birmingham on january the channel broadcast the third evening of the bdo world darts championship because the main channel was showing third round match from the fa cup this happened again year later when for the same reason espn classic again showed the third evening action on may espn classic broadcast two live events the final day of rugby union premiership league season and football match from serie this was due to the main channel showing live coverage of the fa cup final on september espn classic showed live rugby union match from the aviva premiership because the main network was broadcasting its weekly match from football premier league the same happened two weeks later although the clash this time was due to the main channel showing the scottish premier league on and september espn classic showed live coverage of the european darts championship because the main channel was showing the uefa europa league and the aviva premiership respectively the following day sunday rd espn swapped its coverage with the darts being shown on the main channel with much of its traditional sunday fare of european league football plus another aviva premiership match airing on classic on may espn classic was used to provide coverage of second game from the final set of

poison kayla would change his life eventually for the better steve saved kayla from harper once more but kayla ended up losing her ability to speak following surgery to repair her hearing when jack

to eat or drink and delirious jack was shocked to see that it was his brother steve johnson jack could not believe his eyes steve believed himself to be man by the name of nick stockton but dna test proved otherwise intrigued by the possibilities and driven by his brother earnest pleadings that he return home he convinced jack to return home as well on the day of jennifer wedding to frankie brady steve and jack arrived everyone was shocked when jack interrupted the ceremony meanwhile overwhelmed by the pain of returning to salem where she had enjoyed such short time of joy with steve kayla was crying at steve graveside at the cemetery at the church unable to sit through the wedding without breaking down suddenly steve approached her from behind asking her if she was okay the shock of seeing her long lost love caused kayla to faint but when she awoke her wildest dreams were confirmed steve has returned kayla was overjoyed and has tried not to pressure steve who is clearly suffering from amnesia he has shared the memories he does have but continually tells kayla he has no memory of her kayla and steve have spent lot of time together trying to stir up memories she explained to him why the sky was blue and the meaning of mc but upon visit to cincinnati ohio nick stockton old stomping grounds it appeared as though steve was giving up on those missing memories and on kayla she returned to salem and steve would almost immediately follow her steve daughter stephanie also proved to be great draw for him as the young woman joyfully welcomed her thought dead father into her life steve began to push kayla away again trying instead to make love connection with billie reed whom he thought to be more like himself than the classy dr kayla brady at the same time his brother jack made complete recovery and left with wife and son to head up the london spectator news office jack begged his brother to give his love with kayla chance telling him that kayla and steve were meant to be together which was full circle from the times he tried to tear them apart having no memories of his darker past with his brother steve was moved and affected by the younger man words and outpouring of brotherly affection but he still could not make the move towards life with kayla his daughter roundly scolded him for bringing billie with him to watch her race she races cars and steve blamed himself when stephanie was critically injured during the race tearfully at her bedside he had flashback to holding her as baby he still doesn remember kayla but now he remembers stephanie and he terrified of how much it hurts to love her especially as she lies near deaths door steve and kayla were poisoned by biotoxin month later in november steve recovered but kayla hovering near death fell into coma steve pretended to get his memory back with the help of notes of his history with kayla provided by bo and hope to give her the will to carry on it worked and kayla woke up weak but responsive before john and marlena could get back from canada with the antidote for kayla she flatlined and steve became hysterical he lifted her up and gave her long kiss and miraculously her heart started to beat again john and marlena got to the hospital the antidote was administered and kayla began to recover after kayla was released from the hospital steve remained by her side but was distant because of her fragile still recovering state he was hesitant to tell her that his memory had not really returned however kayla suspected the truth as he was distant to find out for certain she asked steve to take trip with her to the bungalow where they had hid from victor kiriakis nearly two decades earlier she wanted to test his memory there steve not knowing that kayla suspected the truth reluctantly agreed once at the bungalow steve decided to tell kayla the truth his memory did not return and he remembered life with separate family different wife and daughter however he cared about kayla and he was just determined to keep kayla alive and wanted to give her the will to live heartbroken but strong kayla surprised steve by telling him that she had already knew that this was the case she excused herself going to another room to silently cry steve promptly fell asleep on the bed and began to have flashes of memories and dreams of kayla waking up in the middle of dream he thought that he and kayla were on the run from victor kiriakis something that had happened nearly years prior entering the room kayla was in he frantically vowed to protect her as kayla shocked didn understand what was going on the flashes of memory became more intense and steve with kayla holding on to him in an attempt to snap him out of his erratic state fell catching his breath he realized kayla could be the love of his life his memory had returned telling kayla tearfully remember loving you kayla was skeptical but steve at first was oblivious he was so overjoyed at having his memory back trying to tell her every memory at once he soon noticed that she was crying and was shocked asking her what was wrong kayla replied that she didn know if she could believe that he had really gotten his memory back especially not after how he had previously pretended to remember her horrified steve grabbed her and assured her that he steven earl johnson her one eyed tomcat was indeed back overcome kayla ran out of the bungalow crying with steve chasing her coming back she nearly fainted still recovering from the biotoxin poisoning and he caught her holding her close and assuring her that everything would be fine after more desperate pleas from steve to believe in him and after he signed courage to her as he did on their wedding day kayla relented they reunited passionately over

resides in the united kingdom governorship diraige is fur born to shartai paramount chief in december as young politician he created the darfur development front ddf to create common agenda to advocate for the region interests however he proved unable to bring all the provincial interests into common front although the front was popular from its creation with fur because of its founder ethnic connections it was open to all darfuris its name suggesting that development should be the primary concern of political action by the time of the february election the politics had become ethnically polarized between rival factions of the umma party sadiq al mahdi calculating that the province demographics favored the african tribes successfully courted the ddf leaving imam al hadi to mobilize the arab vote sadiq faction won of seats while the faction led by al hadi received seven the factions were reconciled only when the parliamentary government was overthrown by the military coup of col gaafar nimeiry in may both diraige and al sadiq were arrested while al hadi was executed in darfuris rioted after their province became the only one in which the governor al tayeb al mardi was not locally chosen nimeiry had chosen al tayeb al mardi to oversee the support to the chadian guerilla force led by hissène habré but grew concerned that he was losing control of the situation in january he dismissed al tayeb al mardi and appointed diraige the appointment of the ddr leader resulted in an immediate lessening of tensions diraige refused to accept salary and quickly concentrated on replacing posts filled due to political patronage with largely apolitical civil servants from across the ethnic spectrum who had all been affiliated with the ddf since the many problems facing the provincial government including rising racial tensions the accumulated administrative neglect and spillover from the conflict in chad was soon superseded by steadily diminishing rains in the provincial elections ethnicity had become dominant political factor and diraige with his large fur base of support and long out of jail easily won the governorship his election in turn sparked plans by darfuri arabs to join with the zaghawa and fellata and form an arab alliance the diraige government soon realized that they could not dig water boreholes quickly enough to make up for the lowered amount of rainfall in november diraige wrote letter to nimeiry warning him that unless foreign food aid was requested darfur faced serious famine this letter would come to be known as the famine letter since nimeiry had been creating an image of sudan as the future breadbasket of the arab world was furious with diraige for sending this inconvenient letter and refused to respond on december diraige flew to khartoum to present his case in person nimeiry made his displeasure clear and stated that he would not ask for aid an arrest warrant for diraige was issued about hours later which he escaped by flying to saudi arabia by august the existence of the famine was obvious and nimeiry was forced to declare darfur disaster zone the story of diraige the first locally accountable governor who had been forced into exile for warning of preventable famine became widely known further aggravating tensions between darfur and the northerner dominated government exile by the situation had worsened the libya chad war overflowed into the province resulting in widespread violence many fur military conscripts fighting the second sudanese civil war deserted to the side of the sudan people liberation army spla sudanese brig fadlallah burma nasir and chief of staff brig fawzi ahmed el fadl visited diraige at his home in london asking if he would come back and support the government to stop the desertion of fur soldiers diraige refused in the late darfuri politician daud bolad sought help from the spla in extending the rebellion to darfur other leftist leaders such as diraige believed that the spla would use them for its own purpose and intentionally did not associate themselves with the southern rebels bolad capture in and the destruction of his resistance network was seen as confirmation that this was the correct stance diraige created the sudan federal democratic alliance sfda member organization of the opposition national democratic alliance from sfda deputy sharif harir set up an office in asmara eritrea from which it actively recruited armed fighters from migrant darfuris on january sudanese vice president ali osman taha met diraige in nairobi while ostensibly on hajj break from talks in naivasha ending the war in the south diraige used his personal credibility to get the darfuri rebels to agree to talks on humanitarian matters in geneva to be mediated by the henri dunant foundation as trust building first step the government then broke diraige trust by publicly demanding meeting on national reconciliation in khartoum this had been the last line of communication that the government still had with the fur rebels in the darfur liberation front new rebel group fighting steadily escalating conflict asked the sfda for political and logistical support harir agreed and declared that the dlf fighters were the military wing of the sfda however diraige disagreed that this was the time for armed rebellion and the dlf got no substantive support

      "the air corps tactical school also known as acts and the tactical school was military professional development school for officers of the united states army air service and united states army air corps the first such school in the world created in at langley field virginia it relocated to maxwell field alabama in july instruction at the school was suspended in anticipating the entry of the united states into world war ii and the school was dissolved shortly after acts was replaced in november by the army air force school of applied tactics in addition to the training of officers in more than areas of military education the school became the doctrine development center of the air corps and preparatory school for air corps officers aspiring to attendance at the army command and general staff college the motto of the air corps tactical school was proficimus more irretenti we make progress unhindered by custom the air corps tactical school was notable as the birthplace of the army air forces doctrine of daylight precision bombing this doctrine held that campaign of daylight air attacks against critical targets of potential enemy industrial infrastructure using long range bombers heavily armed for self defense could defeat an enemy nation even though its army and navy remained intact the tactical school in formulating the doctrine rejected the idea of attacking civilians four former instructors of the school the core of group known as the bomber mafia were grouped together in the air war plans division to produce the two war winning plans awpd and awpd based on the doctrine of precision daylight bombing that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the army air forces in broader sense the strategic bombing doctrine adapted by factors encountered during combat was also the foundation for the final separation of the air force from the army as military service independent of and equal to the other services in the aaf created the air university to carry on the work and traditions of the acts background brig gen william lendrun billy mitchell at the end of world war observation remained the main role of the air service however air combat and limited bombardment operations indicated to veterans of the air service including brig gen billy mitchell that while ideally the service should be separate from the army it at the least should be centralized under an air service commander with some missions independent of direct support of troops in reorganizing the post war army the armed forces reorganization act of stat rebuked these ideas but did establish the air service as statutory entity previously it had existed by executive order only and assigned it status as combatant arm of the line the air service followed the precedent of the other combat arms and began planning for its own service schools an air service school of application for technical training in aeronautical engineering similar to the ordnance school of application at sandy hook new jersey was set up at mccook field and began its first class november maj gen charles menoher director of air service wrote the war department in october for permission to establish tactical school at langley field virginia to train field grade officers in the operation and tactics of the air service as requirement for higher command or staff work on february the war department authorized the air service to establish its service schools in addition to six pilot and advanced pilot training schools and two technical training schools an air service school was planned it proposed to host courses for enlisted personnel as balloon observers balloon mechanics and aerial photography but its main course was to be the field officers course langley field air service field officers school major thomas dewitt milling was assigned as officer in charge of the field officers course at the new school and sent to langley in july to set it up war department general order no authorized the school on august the balloon courses were split off into separate school in different area of langley and the air service school was renamed the air service field officers school on february after its primary function the air service ordered officers to langley eight as students and nine as instructors although several officers swapped roles and some instructors were students as well the class opened on november and although scheduled to last nine months was concluded in may when both students and instructors were assigned to the st provisional air brigade as part of the experimental bombing of captured warships by the air service and the united states navy officers including four instructors graduated the first course the second class beginning in october was devoted to the further training of instructors the creation of sound administrative system and development of well rounded course curriculum in the first two classes despite the school title and function only six of the first graduates were field grade officers board reviewing all service schools of the united states army observed that the field officers school had course load that in other branches of the army was distributed among several schools because all other air service schools were technical training in nature the board recommended that the school be opened to all air service officers regardless of rank accordingly army regulations changed the name of the school to that of air service tactical school on november with the passage of the air corps act of the school again changed its name becoming the air corps tactical school on july while at langley the acts was hampered by chronic shortage of instructors caused by lack of policy within the army for filling vacancies despite rapid turnover in staff in the first three years school administrators were forced to double as instructors the situation was somewhat ameliorated in august when the chief of the air service authorized extended duty for instructors most of whom afterwards served four year tours on the faculty with an overlap between incoming and outgoing staff between and the number of instructors gradually doubled to but even that number proved insufficient to research the vast collection of aviation literature the school library was collecting to establish doctrine despite school recommendations to the contrary class size gradually increased reaching students by the first student from branch other than the air service an infantry officer attended asts in this became standard when the class had five officers representing the other combat branches of the united states army and three from the united states marine corps assigned as students the functioning of the school was also handicapped by lack of permanent facilities especially in quarters and the school did not have permanent academic building when the five year expansion program outlined in the air corps act of failed to address these problems and the creation of new units at langley interrupted the functioning of the practical flying course the air service began seeking new location for the tactical school the class was the last at langley in its eleven years at langley the tactical school graduated students tactical school curriculum the academic curriculum was standardized in by the army board tasked with preparing programs of instruction for all army schools hours of instruction in subjects taught over nine month period beginning on or about september of each school year included approximately hours of tactics including those of other services and combined arms tactics although more than half hours were devoted to air tactics in observation bombardment pursuit and attack aviation approximately hours involved technical subjects including aeronautical engineering armament and gunnery navigation meteorology and photography and to administrative studies covering staff duties combat orders organization of the army military and international law supply and courses in equitation and stable management the curriculum was altered in july by the newly created director of instruction capt earl naiden cutting the academic course by hours to total hours hours of the cuts came from the various tactics subjects although the equitation courses were also eliminated and all academic courses were scheduled in mornings naiden added courses in the history of the air service and map reading to the academics and hour afternoon course in practical flying instituted to provide refresher training to pilots but required of all students including those of non aviation branches the course structure remained the same until with changes only in individual course subjects averaging hours per week of classroom study and hours weekly of flying the first printed texts covering air tactics replaced mimeographed texts in this development of the tactics portion of the school led to increased emphasis and in aeronautical engineering was eliminated from the curriculum theoretical use of airpower was first advanced in and beginning in new course was taught at the end of each class the air force coordinating all air topics covered during the year army regulations also made the commander of the nd wing as the base commander at langley the commandant of the tactical school however during its first four years this caused little disruption as milling first as officer in charge and then as assistant commandant remained in actual charge of the school in maj oscar westover became the first commandant to exercise control over school activities the assistant commandant then became responsible for academics assisted by the director of instruction directors of the individual academic departments and the school secretary formerly the school adjutant course instruction assumed pattern combining both theory and practical instruction subjects were generally scheduled in blocks particularly tactics beginning with those of other branches and services along with logistics and staff functions from the beginning of each class until december the courses in air tactics followed described by one student as coming with bewildering rapidity practical instruction came in the form of field problems initiated in the classroom then demonstrated and practiced in the practical flying course annual inspection trips were also undertaken until to the engineering division at mccook and wright fields in dayton ohio when trips began to the infantry school at fort benning georgia beginning in acts students also participated in the annual army war college maneuvers at ft dupont delaware however by doctrinal disagreements between the schools and the exclusion of acts staff from the planning process created perceived misuse of airpower on the part of awc planners that acts assistant commandant maj john curry criticized as not being of value to students of either school although air corps input resulted in some improvements lack of funds eliminated acts participation after maxwell field relocation austin hall air corps tactical school difficulties with dilapidated facilities at langley were not resolved and proposed relocation to staten island was rejected by the staff for lack of year round flying weather urban restrictions on flying and lack of support facilities locations at bolling field washington richmond virginia san antonio texas fort riley kansas and another area of langley field were studied before the choice was made of maxwell field depot in montgomery alabama as the site for the school plans were developed for campus to accommodate tactical school of students squadron officers school of junior officer students and school demonstration flying group of four squadrons congress appropriated almost by july for new buildings including building austin hall to house the tactical school and to purchase acreage on which to build new officer quarters delays in construction caused two postponements of the relocation until june when austin hall was completed on july the school completed its move although officer quarters were not begun until architects commissioned by the quartermaster corps designed residences for officers in an elegant style they deemed french provencial and placed them in neighborhood setting that became the showplace of the air corps the construction program at maxwell continued until funded primarily by the wpa and pwa bombing and gunnery range was also set up near valparaiso florida for tactical school use course restructured aerial view of maxwell field in in curry now acts commandant reorganized the academic structure of the school along functional lines into three principal departments air tactics ground tactics and basic and special instruction flying was fourth department the air force attack bombardment pursuit and observation sections were placed within the department of air tactics the next year these departments became the department of air tactics and strategy department of ground tactics and department of command staff and logistics four faculty committees were also established to administrate scheduling the school library and publication of doctrine the air corps board which had been inactive since the move from langley was permanently relocated to maxwell in restructured by the tactical school faculty who doubled as its members the board was directed by the war department to formulate air corps doctrine the board became from the tactical school and undertook projects between and third of which dealt with tactical doctrine and the remainder with equipment armaments field manuals and training texts after the move to maxwell the practice of requiring students to fly actual missions as part of the instruction process was discontinued for safety reasons plans for composite school group were suspended by the chief of the air corps because of service wide shortage of personnel and aircraft and attempts to have demonstrations by existing combat units were mostly unsatisfactory the demonstration group was not authorized until august and was utilized for less than year before classes were suspended in the department of flying instruction was dissolved and its functions parceled out to the remaining departments the department of air tactics and strategy became the dominant division at the school and its air force section the most important course in which airpower theories were presented and explored doctrine emerging as much from the students as from the faculty association with the infantry school increased but inspection trips formerly used at langley first became voluntary and then were discontinued only handful of graduates had gone on to attend the command and general staff school and as result the tactical school ended its role as preparatory school instead the acts became the equivalent for air corps officers of gss and increased the emphasis on air subjects to more than half of the total course hours by with an accompanying decrease in hours for ground and administrative subjects classroom studies were similarly altered lectures occupied only half of classroom hour with the remainder given over to discussion and debate of concepts presented and of alternative ideas short course the limited class size at the tactical school led the air corps in to study the feasibility of using series of shorter courses to allow greater number of officers to attend the study concluded that significant number of potential staff and command officers had not attended the school and was growing annually it recommended that the nine month course be discontinued for year and four week courses scheduled each having students all drawn from the group of prospective senior staff the plan had the drawbacks of limiting the amount of detail to which students could be exposed and would require rebuilding of the staff and curriculum when the long course was reinstated nevertheless the curriculum was changed from academic hours to the short courses began on june and continued for the next year theory and doctrine ascendance of bomber theory in its first years the tactical school taught that pursuit aviation was the most important of air operations epitomized by the class text employment of combined air force that compared the importance of pursuit to the air service to that of infantry to the army however in the tactical school modified this principle by asserting for the first time that airpower could strike at vital points deep inside enemy territory rather than merely targeting an enemy military forces in war of attrition by the tactical school was teaching that determined air attack once launched is most difficult if not impossible to stop this shift in emphasis from pursuit to bombardment was the result of two factors the air war theories of the time and the state of aviation technology devotees of billy mitchell many of whom had served with the st provisional air brigade dominated the faculty of the tactical school at maxwell with their students they developed theory of warfare that invoked the superiority of the long range bomber over all other types of aircraft going beyond mitchell ideas they de emphasized balanced forces and support of ground troops in favor of doctrine that heavily armed bombers could fight their way to industrial targets in daylight unescorted by fighters and with precision bombing made possible by the introduction of the norden bombsight in defeat an enemy by destroying key war production targets rather than engaging in costly and prolonged ground campaigns aimed at destroying enemy armies while the theory was based on tenets of strategic airpower developed by mitchell hugh trenchard and giulio douhet it rejected the concept of terror bombing of civil populations as means of destroying the morale and coercing the will of an enemy state the formulators of this doctrine were relatively young junior officers nearly all of them former reservists commissioned during or immediately after world war they viewed war in the abstract admitted and even apologized for being unable to offer conclusive proof of their theories but firmly believed that the dominance of airpower lay ahead in the future when existing limitations of technology had been overcome nine key advocates all of whom instructed at the tactical school became known as the bomber mafia the unofficial leader of the group was the bombardment section chief and later director of the department of air tactics and strategy major harold george the doctrine brought them in conflict with the army general staff which did not view airpower as major striking arm but as an auxiliary to the ground forces despite the poor performance of what few bombers the air corps possessed the air theorists persisted in their beliefs testifying in favor of separate air force before commissions set up in the wake of the air mail scandal although flawed and tested only under optimal conditions the doctrine originally known as the industrial web theory became the primary airpower strategy of the united states in the planning for world war ii four former instructors of the school the core of the bomber mafia produced the two airpower war plans awpd and awpd that guided the wartime expansion and deployment of the army air forces failure of pursuit theory the doctrine was not universally held among air officers however claire chennault chief of the pursuit section between and reasoned that the same technology that would increase the performance of the bomber would also eventually enable the single engine fighter to challenge the bomber at high altitude which it could not do in the years when the daylight bombing doctrine was formulated combined with centralized early warning and control system which came with the development of radar defending interceptors would inflict serious losses on unescorted forces the doctrine also ran counter to the theories of billy mitchell who believed that pursuit support was essential for daylight bombing operations chennault however also had blind spot in his zealous advocacy of fighters as the offensive weapon of the air corps he consciously avoided acknowledging the role of accompanying escort fighters as part of an offensive air strike when his tour at acts ended the fighter versus bomber controversy became moot point among the staff to the detriment of developing role for escort fighters although the proponents of daylight precision bombing at the tactical school had failure of imagination in not expanding the doctrine to include establishing air superiority as prerequisite for success and thus contributed to the delay in the development of long range escort fighter until two years into the war the doctrine nonetheless became the foundation for the separation of the air force from the army and the basis for modern airpower theory acts graduate instructor and bomber mafia member haywood hansell concurred that both the theorists and the authors of the awpd war plan he was both made serious mistake in neglecting long range fighter escort in their ideas hansell wrote it was recognized that fighter escort was inherently desirable but no one could quite conceive how small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet retain its combat maneuverability failure to see this issue through proved one of the air corps tactical school major shortcomings however he also stated that ignorance of radar was fortuitous in the long run he surmised that had radar been factor in doctrine many theorists would have reasoned that massed defenses would make all strategic air attacks too costly inhibiting if not entirely suppressing the concepts that proved decisive in world war ii and essential to the creation of the united states air force development of fighters was not ignored by october over year before pearl harbor every type of piston driven single engine fighter used by the united states army air forces usaaf in world war ii had made its first flight except the thunderbolt however the press of the enormous tasks confronting the air corps and the primacy of strategic bombing doctrine meant that development of long range capability for these new fighters was not undertaken until combat losses to bombers forced the issue school closure and legacy before the short courses began president franklin roosevelt called for an expansion of the air corps in january the need for experienced officers to supervise the expansion led to plans to reduce the size of the faculty and long course classes as compromise to keep the school functioning six of the air corps instructors would be returned to regular duty and class sizes would be reduced from to students however world war ii in europe began on september before the staff and class reductions could be implemented the air corps permitted the short courses to be finished but suspended all instruction on june the tactical school was reduced to caretaker staff of seven officers including two librarians one year later the tactical school came under the control of the southeast air corps training center headquartered at maxwell with the objective of re opening the school immediately after completion of study the center recommended in july that the tactical school curriculum be modified into ten week basic course in tactics for squadron and group level junior grade officers to instruct officers its first year and officers thereafter ending its twin missions of senior officer service school and doctrine development center instead the air corps board was moved to eglin field florida and absorbed by the air corps proving ground while all remaining staff of the tactical school were transferred to washington where they continued work mainly the production of training literature until june after which the school went unstaffed until its formal dissolution in the acts at maxwell graduated officers of them in the short courses during its entire history the tactical school trained officers of them in the air service or air corps graduates from other arms included army officers marines and five naval officers the tactical school also trained officers from foreign countries of the general officers in the army air forces at the end of world war ii were tactical school graduates including of the highest ranking aaf generals officers including from the army and navy served on the faculty of the tactical school during its years of existence of whom became general officers the senior service school function was abandoned for the duration of world war ii in favor of development of an actual tactical center responsible for the mass teaching of all aspects of air warfare to inexperienced officers who would become commanders of newly created units although commandants at acts had lobbied throughout its existence for the tactical school to serve as the nucleus of such center it instead became the function of new school the army air force school of applied tactics activated october in orlando florida both for the training of unit cadres and the continuing development of tactical doctrine the experiences of world war ii created new impetus for professional education of air commanders as it had after world war but on much vaster scale the expectation of becoming separate service from the army resulted in planning for

sewing and sewing machines many of these inventions have been referenced by other inventors in their own designs improvement in sewing machines this invention created way to form button hole stitch or zig zag stitch that when used to close seam gave strength to the piece the stitch could be varied in several different ways such as varying the depth of the needle the original sewing machine with this adaptation is currently housed in the smithsonian national museum of american history improvement in elastic seams for garments this invention is method of stitching that produces strong elastic stitch with minimal alterations to the material used in the process besides adjusting the tension of the fabric improvement in elastic goring for shoes this invention is way to strengthen shoes by reinforcing the goring keeping the pieces of shoe together series of rows of stitches made from one strand of regular thread and one rubber thread is used to create type of goring that could withstand more movement compared to the previous method improvement in welted and covered seams this invention is method for which two edges of material once stitched together to form seam could be made flat this could be done by either inserting welt or by sewing strip over the seam spool case this invention is simple cover for spools of silk cotton thread or other material that protects the spool from becoming dirty damaged or unwound method of securing reeds or cords to the edges of material this invention is method of securing reeds or cords to the edges of materials especially securing reeds to hat sweat bands this is done by folding the edges of the material around the reed or cord before sewing sewing needle this invention is an improvement to the sewing needle by making it possible to thread the needle with one hand for efficiency this is done by adding latch that allows the needle to open making it possible for the user to place the thread in the slot instead of threading it through hole surgical needle this invention is an improvement to previous surgical needles the needle has lancet point which allows it to pierce skin easily with minimal resistance and therefore less pain to the patient the notch on the backside of the needle allows the thread to disconnect from the needle by just withdrawing from the skin sewing machine needle this invention is type of needle used in sewing machines where one or more thread is used to form stitches the needle has the ability to pierce the goods to be sewed and contains notch that supplies another thread to create the stitch seam for sewed articles this invention is way to connect two edges of material specifically knit fabrics and over edging this method uses series of loops made from single thread going through the two edges of the material to create seam hat sewing machine this invention is an adaptation to the sewing machine that allows it to stitch common chain stitch with one thread to be used to sew sweatbands and strips of linen onto the inside edge of the hat previously this work had been done by hand so this machine increased the rate of production by simplifying the work needed to be done method of selvage sewing this invention is method for primarily bringing together the edges of selvage knit goods but can also be used with other fabric for decorative uses this method helps smooth out curls in fabric and helps create flat seam that was not previously possible see also margaret knight references\n",
      "egalitarianism as revolt against nature and other essays is book by economist murray rothbard the book represents the author theorizing on topics impacting human liberty rothbard looks beyond conventional left right thinking and hence contributes to the groundwork for the current intellectual challenge against centralized social and economic management the book title comes from the lead essay which argues that egalitarian theory always results in politics of statist control because it is founded on revolt against the ontological structure of reality itself according to rothbard in this lead essay statist intellectuals attempt to replace what exists with romantic image of an idealized primitive state of nature an ideal which cannot and should not be achieved according to rothbard the implications of this point are worked out on topics such as market economics child rights feminism foreign policy redistribution and others roy childs writes in the foreword for until rothbard work is carefully studied by every advocate of liberty the value of his contributions to the libertarian system cannot be fully appreciated and moreover the unity and true historical context of libertarianism will not even be fully grasped publishing history auburn alabama ludwig von mises institute paperback washington libertarian review press june references external links egalitarianism as revolt against nature and other essays full text pdf file of the second edition\n",

      "the gweagal tribe opposing the arrival of captain james cook in the history of indigenous australians began at least years ago when aboriginal australians populated australia the aboriginals were semi nomadic hunter gatherers with strong spiritual connection to the land water and animals each group developed skills for the area in which they would live with significant diversity between groups the origin of australia indigenous people remains matter of debate and conjecture they are believed to be among the earliest human migrations out of africa although they likely migrated to australia through southeast asia they are not demonstrably related to any known asian or polynesian population there is evidence of genetic and linguistic interchange between australians in the far north and the austronesian peoples of modern day new guinea and the islands but this may be the result of recent trade and intermarriage at the time of first european contact it is estimated that between and people lived in australia with upper estimates being as high as million cumulative population of billion people has been estimated to have lived in australia over years prior to british colonisation the regions of heaviest indigenous population were the same temperate coastal regions that are currently the most heavily populated in the early it was commonly believed that the indigenous population of australia was leading toward extinction the population shrunk from in to in this was due in part to an outbreak of diseases such as smallpox post colonisation the coastal indigenous populations were soon absorbed depleted or forced from their lands the traditional aspects of aboriginal life which remained persisted most strongly in areas such as the great sandy desert where european settlement has been sparse the greatest population density was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent the murray river valley in particular however aboriginal australians maintained successful communities throughout australia from the cold and wet highlands of tasmania to the more arid parts of the continental interior technologies diets and hunting practices varied according to the local environment origins the sunda shelf and sahul shelf it is believed that the first early human migration to australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the sahul continent connected to the island of new guinea via land bridge it is also possible that people came by island hopping via an island chain between sulawesi and new guinea and the other reaches north western australia via timor the exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the aboriginal australians has been matter of dispute among archaeologists the most generally accepted date for first arrival is between years bp near penrith in new south wales since numerous aboriginal stone tools have been found in cranebrook terraces gravel sediments having dates of to years bp when these results were new they were controversial but more recent dating of the same strata in and has corroborated these dates bc date is based on few sites in northern australia dated using large number of sites have been radiocarbon dated to around bc leading some researchers to doubt the accuracy of the technique radiocarbon dating is limited to maximum age of around years some estimates have been given as widely as from to bc earlier dates are requiring new techniques such as optically stimulated luminescence osl and accelerator mass spectrometry ams and the evidence for an earlier date of arrival is growing charles dortch has dated recent finds on rottnest island western australia at years bp the rock shelters at malakunanja ii shallow rock shelter about kilometres inland from the present coast and of nauwalabila kilometres further south show evidence of used pieces of ochre evidence for paint used by artists years ago using osl rhys jones has obtained date for stone tools in these horizons dating from years ago dating of the jinmium site in the northern territory suggested date of plus or minus bce although this result received wide press coverage it is not accepted by most archaeologists only africa has older physical evidence of habitation by modern humans there is also evidence of change in fire regimes in australia drawn from reef deposits in queensland between and years ago and the integration of human genomic evidence from various parts of the world also supports date of before years for the arrival of australian aboriginal people in the continent humans reached tasmania approximately years ago by migrating across land bridge from the mainland that existed during the last glacial maximum after the seas rose about years ago and covered the land bridge the inhabitants there were isolated from the mainland until the arrival of european settlers short statured aboriginal tribes inhabited the rainforests of north queensland of which the best known group is probably the tjapukai of the cairns area these rainforest people collectively referred to as barrineans were once considered to be relic of an earlier wave of negrito migration to the australian continent but this theory no longer finds much favour mungo man whose remains were discovered in near lake mungo in new south wales is the oldest human yet found in australia although the exact age of mungo man is in dispute the best consensus is that he is at least years old stone tools also found at lake mungo have been estimated based on stratigraphic association to be about years old since lake mungo is in south eastern australia many archaeologists have concluded that humans must have arrived in north west australia at least several thousand years earlier in the results of large scale genotyping has indicated that aboriginal australians the indigenous peoples of new guinea and the mamanwa an indigenous people of the southern philippines are closely related having diverged from common origin approximately years ago the same studies show that aboriginal genomes consist of up to indian dna which is uniformly spread through northern australia indicating substantial gene flow between indian populations and northern australia occurred around years ago changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the archaeological record around this time suggesting there may have been migration from india geography the shoreline of tasmania and victoria about years ago as sea levels were rising showing some of the human archaeological sites when the north west of australia which is closest to asia was first occupied the region consisted of open tropical forests and woodlands after around years of stable climatic conditions by which time the aboriginal people had settled the entire continent temperatures began cooling and winds became stronger leading to the beginning of an ice age by the glacial maximum to years ago the sea level had dropped to around metres below its present level australia was connected to new guinea and the kimberley region of western australia was separated from southeast asia wallacea by strait only approximately km wide rainfall was to lower than modern levels depending on region while the lower co levels half pre industrial levels meant that vegetation required twice as much water for photosynthesis the kimberley including the adjacent exposed continental sahul shelf was covered by vast grasslands dominated by flowering plants of the family poaceae with woodlands and semi arid scrub covering the shelf joining new guinea to australia southeast of the kimberley from the gulf of carpentaria to northern tasmania the land including the western and southern margins of the now exposed continental shelves was covered largely by extreme deserts and sand dunes it is believed that during this period no more than of australia supported trees of any kind while some tree cover remained in the southeast of australia the vegetation of the wetter coastal areas in this region was semi arid savannah while some tropical rainforests survived in isolated coastal areas of queensland tasmania was covered primarily by cold steppe and alpine grasslands with snow pines at lower altitudes there is evidence that there may have been significant reduction in australian aboriginal populations during this time and there would seem to have been scattered refugia in which the modern vegetation types and aboriginal populations were able to survive corridors between these refugia seem to be routes by which people kept in contact and they seem to have been the basis for what are now called songlines today with the end of the ice age strong rains returned until around years ago when the wet season cycle in the north ended bringing with it megadrought that lasted years the return of reliable rains around years bp gave australia its current climate following the ice age aboriginal people around the coast from arnhem land the kimberley and the southwest of western australia all tell stories of former territories that were drowned beneath the sea with the rising coastlines after the ice age it was this event that isolated the tasmanian aboriginal people on their island and probably led to the extinction of aboriginal cultures on the bass strait islands and kangaroo island in south australia in the interior the end of the ice age may have led to the recolonisation of the desert and semi desert areas by aboriginal people of the northern territory this in part may have been responsible for the spread of languages of the pama nyungan language family and secondarily responsible for the spread of male initiation rites involving circumcision there has been long history of contact between papuan peoples of the western province torres strait islanders and the aboriginal people in cape york the aboriginal australians lived through great climatic changes and adapted successfully to their changing physical environment there is much ongoing debate about the degree to which they modified the environment one controversy revolves around the role of indigenous people in the extinction of the marsupial megafauna also see australian megafauna some argue that natural climate change killed the megafauna others claim that because the megafauna were large and slow they were easy prey for human hunters third possibility is that human modification of the environment particularly through the use of fire indirectly led to their extinction oral history demonstrates the continuity of culture of indigenous australians for at least years this is shown by correlation of oral history stories with verifiable incidents including known changes in sea levels and their associated large changes in location of ocean shorelines oral records of megafauna and comets lifestyle ecology woomera in the eora language and two examples of boomerangs boomerangs could be used for hunting most were non returning or purely for music and ceremony the introduction of the dingo possibly as early as bc showed that contact with south east asian peoples continued as the closest genetic connection to the dingo seems to be the wild dogs of thailand this contact was not just one way as the presence of kangaroo ticks on these dogs demonstrates dingoes began and evolved in asia the earliest known dingo like fossils are from ban chiang in north east thailand dated at years bp and from north vietnam years bp according to skull morphology these fossils occupy place between asian wolves prime candidates were the pale footed or indian wolf canis lupus pallipes and the arabian wolf canis lupus arabs and modern dingoes in australia and thailand most scientists presently believe that it was the arrival of the australian aboriginal people on the continent and their introduction of fire stick farming that was responsible for these extinctions fossil research published in indicates that aboriginal people and megafauna coexisted for at least years aboriginal australians used fire for variety of purposes to encourage the growth of edible plants and fodder for prey to reduce the risk of catastrophic bushfires to make travel easier to eliminate pests for ceremonial purposes for warfare and just to clean up country there is disagreement however about the extent to which this burning led to large scale changes in vegetation patterns food aboriginal grinding stones pestle and mortar vital in making flours for bush bread aboriginal women were expert at making bread from variety of seasonal grains and nuts aboriginal australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area but they knew exactly when where and how to find everything edible anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in arnhem land found it to be well balanced with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend but food was not obtained without effort in some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food each day the women of the horde went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons larger animals and birds such as kangaroos and emus were speared or disabled with thrown club boomerang or stone many indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey the men were excellent trackers and stalkers approaching their prey running where there was cover or freezing and crawling when in the open they were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell fish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of pool until they rose to the surface or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them fish spears nets wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas lines with hooks made from bone shell wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts dugong turtle and large fish were harpooned the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust the mode of life and material cultures varied greatly from region to region while torres strait island populations were who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods most aboriginal australians were hunter gatherers aboriginal australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen some aboriginal and torres strait islander people relied on the dingo as companion animal using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights coolamon lined with paperbark and digging stick this woven basket style is from northern australia baskets were used for collecting fruits corms seeds and even water some baskets were woven so tightly as to be watertight in present day victoria for example there were two separate communities with an economy based on eel farming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems one on the murray river in the state north the other in the south west near hamilton in the territory of the djab wurrung which traded with other groups from as far away as the melbourne area see gunditjmara primary tool used in hunting is the spear launched by woomera or spear thrower in some locales boomerangs were also used by some mainland indigenous australians the non returnable boomerang known more correctly as throwing stick more powerful than the returning kind could be used to injure or even kill kangaroo on mainland australia no animal other than the dingo was domesticated however domestic pigs were utilised by torres strait islanders the typical aboriginal diet included wide variety of foods such as pig kangaroo emu wombats goanna snakes birds many insects such as honey ants bogong moths and witchetty grubs many varieties of plant foods such as taro coconuts nuts fruits and berries were also eaten culture lomandra plant used by aboriginal australians for weaving permanent villages were the norm for most torres strait island communities in some areas mainland aboriginal australians also lived in semi permanent villages most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for more settled existence most indigenous communities were semi nomadic moving in regular cycle over defined territory following seasonal food sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year from the examination of middens archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by indigenous communities for thousands of years in the more arid areas aboriginal australians were nomadic ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources there is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time rock painting at several locations in northern australia has been shown to consist of sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods there is also prominent rock paintings found in the sydney basin area which date to around years harry lourandos has been the leading proponent of the theory that period of hunter gatherer intensification occurred between and bce intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment for example the construction of eel traps in victoria population growth an increase in trade between groups more elaborate social structure and other cultural changes shift in stone tool technology involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers occurred around this time this was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the australian dingo many indigenous communities also have very complex kinship structure and in some places strict rules about marriage in traditional societies men are required to marry women of specific moiety the system is still alive in many central australian communities to enable men and women to find suitable partners many groups would come together for annual gatherings commonly known as corroborees at which goods were traded news exchanged and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies this practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented inbreeding in society based on small semi nomadic groups impact of british colonisation european settlement th century engraving of an aboriginal australian encampment showing the indigenous lifestyle in the cooler parts of australia at the time of european settlement in lieutenant james cook claimed the east coast of australia in the name of the united kingdom and named it new south wales cook declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with first australians in spite of his direct written orders from the admiralty which instructed him to conclude treaty with the inhabitants if any and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land british colonisation of australia began in sydney in the most immediate consequence of british settlement within weeks of the first colonists arrival was wave of european epidemic diseases such as chickenpox smallpox influenza and measles which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement the worst hit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities where disease could spread more readily in the arid centre of the continent where small communities were spread over vast area the population decline was less marked disease was the principal cause of population decline the second consequence of british settlement was appropriation of land and water resources the settlers took the view that aboriginal australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else in fact the loss of traditional lands food sources and water resources was often fatal particularly to communities already weakened by disease additionally aboriginal australians groups had deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and well being of the group could not be maintained proximity to settlers also brought venereal disease to which aboriginal australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced aboriginal fertility and birthrates settlers also brought alcohol opium and tobacco and substance abuse has remained chronic problem for aboriginal communities ever since entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace often before european settlers arrived or recorded their existence diseases deadly infectious diseases like smallpox influenza and tuberculosis were always major causes of aboriginal deaths smallpox alone killed more than of the aboriginal population in disastrous smallpox epidemic broke out killing up to of the indigenous people of the sydney region based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the first fleet it has been surmised that the aborigines of the sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it unable to understand or counter the sickness they often fled leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves as the clans fled the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland this had disastrous effect on aboriginal society with many of the productive hunters and gatherers dead those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve lieutenant william bradley recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the aboriginal population of sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times the british had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the first fleet these were subsequently dismissed by surgeon general john white who believed they were suffering from slight inflammatory complaints the origin of the smallpox epidemic is controversial and it has been speculated that the surgeons on board the first fleet brought vials of smallpox matter and either accidentally or intentionally released it as biological weapon in writing in journal of australian studies christopher warren concluded that british marines were most likely to have spread smallpox possibly without informing governor phillip but conceded in his conclusion that today evidence only provides for balancing of probabilities and this is all that can be attempted conflicts on the mainland prolonged conflict followed the frontier of european settlement in john dunmore lang wrote there is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of new south wales of which all the waters of new holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains in an aboriginal leader pemulwuy in sydney resisted the europeans waging guerrilla style warfare on the settlers in series of wars known as the hawkesbury and nepean wars which spanned years from to in twenty eight aboriginal people were killed at the myall creek massacre seven of the convict settlers responsible six white men and one african man were tried convicted and hung for the murders many aboriginal communities resisted the settlers such as the noongar of south western australia led by yagan who was killed in the kalkadoon of queensland also resisted the settlers and there was massacre of over people on their land at battle mountain in there was massacre at coniston in the northern territory in poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions the number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate with figure of around deaths being advanced by historians such as henry reynolds however the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts forcing historians to estimate country wide white black death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of aboriginal deaths reynolds and other historians estimate that up to white people were killed by aboriginal australians in the frontier violence by the all the fertile areas of australia had been appropriated and aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of european communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement the palawah or indigenous people of tasmania were particularly hard hit nearly all of them apparently numbering somewhere between and when white settlement began were dead by the it is widely claimed that this was the result of genocidal policy in the form of the black war other historians dispute this geoffrey blainey wrote that in tasmania by disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating josephine flood wrote the catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones historian keith windschuttle also disagrees that violence was the principal cause he argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately aboriginal tasmanians killed in that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in self defence by settlers windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzle loading single shot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of relatively low level of conflict another scholar willis has subsequently disputed windschuttle figures and has documented palawah killed by settlers in alone with possibly another killed during the same period such counts do not consider undocumented violence and must be regarded as minimum estimates it is also claimed but untrue that the last aboriginal tasmanian was truganini who died in this belief stems from distinction between full bloods and half castes that is now generally regarded as racist palawah people survived in missions set up on the islands of bass strait this portrait of young indigenous boy was commissioned by member of christian mission station to show the achievements of the mission at civilising the indigenous population nevertheless some initial contact between aboriginal people and europeans was peaceful starting with the guugu yimithirr people who met james cook near cooktown in bennelong served as interlocutor between the eora people of sydney and the british colony and was the first aboriginal australian to travel to england staying there between and aboriginal people were known to help european explorers such as john king who lived with tribe for two and half months after the ill fated burke and wills expedition of also living with indigenous people was william buckley an escaped convict who was with the wautharong people near melbourne for thirty two years before being found in many indigenous people adapted to european culture working as stock hands or labourers the first australian cricket team which toured england in was principally made up of indigenous players agriculture as the european pastoral industries developed several economic changes came about the appropriation of prime land and the spread of european livestock over vast areas made traditional indigenous lifestyle less viable but also provided ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers anger by hunting livestock the impact of disease and the settlers industries had profound impact on the indigenous australians way of life with the exception of few in the remote interior all surviving indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood in south eastern australia during the large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the australian goldrushes indigenous women men and children became significant source of labour most indigenous labour was unpaid instead indigenous workers received rations in the form of food clothing and other basic necessities in the later th century settlers made their way north and into the interior appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use waterholes and soaks in particular and introducing sheep rabbits and cattle all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to indigenous economies indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle incurring the wrath of graziers after they replaced the native animals as food source as large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern australia indigenous workers were quickly recruited several other outback industries notably pearling also employed aboriginal workers in many areas christian missions provided food and clothing for indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for indigenous children in some places colonial governments provided some resources aboriginal bora ceremony early th century in spite of the impact of disease violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom some indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the th century in around aboriginal people answered the call to arms despite restrictions on indigenous australians serving in the military as the war continued these restrictions were relaxed as more recruits were needed many enlisted by claiming they were māori or indian by the the indigenous population had declined to between and and the belief that the indigenous australians would soon die out was widely held even among australians sympathetic to their situation but by about those indigenous australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances from the the availability of penicillin to treat imported diseases also had marked effect on reversing the population decline in the northern territory significant frontier conflict continued both isolated europeans and visiting asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of world war ii in it is known that some european settlers in the centre and north of the country shot indigenous people during this period one particular series of killings became known as the caledon bay crisis and became watershed in the relationship between indigenous and non indigenous australians in the early th century anthropologists influence dominated society view of aboriginals in australia they were viewed as different race that was not as evolved as europeans starting in the and continuing into the th century debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms in the mid there was shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards cultural anthropological concerns established by field work new studies described aboriginals social organisation religious belief and practice alfred radcliffe brown the father of modern social anthropology published his social organization of australian tribes in by the end of world war ii many indigenous men had served in the military and were paid an equitable salary however aboriginal workers remained unfree labourers paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations and had their movements severely restricted by regulations and or police action on february jack patten led strike at cummeragunja mission in new south wales the people of cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was draconian system once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control and residents were forced to subsist on meager rations approximately people left their homes taking part in the cummeragunja walk off and the majority crossed the border into victoria never to return home on may aboriginal station workers in the pilbara region of western australia started the pilbara strike and never returned to work mass layoffs across northern australia followed the federal pastoral industry award of which required the payment of minimum wage to aboriginal station workers as they were not paid by the pastoralist discretion many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government many of the workers and their families became refugees or fringe dwellers living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities present in the right to vote in federal elections was extended to indigenous australians who had served in the armed forces or were enrolled to vote in state elections at that time those indigenous australians who lived in queensland western australia and the northern territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections all indigenous australians were given the right to vote in commonwealth elections in australia by the menzies government in the first federal election in which all aboriginal australians could vote was held in november the right to vote in state elections was granted in western australia in and queensland was the last state to do so in the referendum passed with majority allowed indigenous australians to be included in the commonwealth parliament power to make special laws for specific races and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation this has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of australia referendums in yolngu people at yirrkala sought an injunction against nabalco to cease mining on their traditional land in the resulting historic and controversial gove land rights case justice blackburn ruled that australia had been terra nullius before european settlement and that no concept of native title existed in australian law although the yolngu people were defeated in this action the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law which led first to the woodward commission and then to the aboriginal land rights act in the aboriginal tent embassy was established on the steps of parliament house in canberra in response to the sentiment among indigenous australians that they were strangers in their own country tent embassy still exists on the same site in the whitlam government drafted the aboriginal land rights act which aimed to restore traditional lands to indigenous people after the dismissal of the whitlam government by the governor general reduced scope version of the act known as the aboriginal land rights act was introduced by the coalition government led by malcolm fraser while its application was limited to the northern territory it did grant inalienable freehold title to some traditional lands in group of pintupi people who were living traditional hunter gatherer desert dwelling life were tracked down in the gibson desert in western australia and brought into settlement they are believed to have been the last uncontacted tribe in australia federal government report described the history of the aboriginal homelands movement or return to country movement as concerted attempt by aboriginal people in the remote areas of australia to leave government settlements reserves missions and non aboriginal townships and to re occupy their traditional country in the australian high court handed down its decision in the mabo case declaring the previous legal concept of terra nullius to be invalid this decision legally recognised certain land claims of indigenous australians in australia prior to british settlement legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise native title claims over land in australia in as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of indigenous children see stolen generation from their families national sorry day was instituted to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to indigenous families many politicians from both sides of the house participated with the notable exception of the prime minister john howard in referendum was held to change the australian constitution to include preamble that amongst other topics recognised the occupation of australia by indigenous australians prior to british settlement this referendum was defeated though the recognition of indigenous australians in the preamble was not major issue in the referendum discussion and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming republic in the australian government abolished the aboriginal and torres strait islander commission atsic which had been australia top indigenous organisation the commonwealth cited corruption and in particular made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by atsic chairman geoff clark as the principal reason indigenous specific programmes have been mainstreamed that is reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population the office of indigenous policy coordination was established within the then department of immigration and multicultural and indigenous affairs and now with the department of families community services and indigenous affairs to coordinate whole of government effort in june richard frankland founder of the your voice political party in an open letter to prime minister john howard advocated that the eighteenth century conflicts between aboriginal and colonial australians be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the australian war memorial in its editorial on june melbourne newspaper the age said that frankland has raised an important question and asked whether moving work commemorating aborigines who lost their lives defending their land to the war memorial would change the way we regard aboriginal history in prime minister kevin rudd made

      "álvaro carlos alsogaray june april was an argentine politician and businessman minister of economy during much of the period he was one of the principal proponents of economic conservatism in modern argentina biography early career alsogaray was born in esperanza santa fe in as the eldest of three children to julia elisa bosch and álvaro alsogaray born to prominent local military family alsogaray graduated from the national military college as an infantry officer he studied military engineering in the army school of higher technical studies and civil and aeronautical engineer at the national university of córdoba he married edith gay in and had two sons and daughter he retired from the army with the rank of captain and with two engineering degrees which led to his being called el capitán ingeniero he entered business becoming an important contractor for state enterprises such as fama predecessor of flag carrier aerolíneas argentinas and briefly served as its director during the presidency of juan perón whose populist politics and policies would later be anathema to alsogaray thinking after the coup that removed perón in he held the posts of under secretary of commerce and minister of industry and maintained numerous peronist staffers at the despite his support for the coup he founded the independent civic party in the party fared modestly in the elections president frondizi and the two winters alsogaray and president arturo frondizi left who appointed the conservative businessman under pressure from the military to placate powerful agrarian interests and other conservatives the otherwise progressive arturo frondizi named alsogaray minister of the economy in early inheriting large trade deficits alsogaray sharply devalued the peso and imposed severe credit controls on argentina large public banks declaring that the economy must go through winter the austerity measures were boon to exporters but caused consumer prices to double in and real wages and construction to fall by about the resulting trade surplus and pro growth policies pursued by frondizi unofficial point man on the economy rogelio julio frigerio both contributed to robust recovery in and marginalized in favor of frigerio after the recession and deeply unpopular alsogaray resigned early in frigerio had been president frondizi first choice for the critical economy ministry an appointment thwarted by the military frondizi and frigerio later founded the mid political party centered around the need for accelerated development frondizi efforts to mediate differences between the united states and cuba ultimately resulted in march coup état and álvaro alsogaray was able to use the influence of his brother general julio alsogaray to secure several ministerial and planning posts under frondizi military appointed successor senate president josé maría guido reintroducing many of his restrictive policies as well as nearly worthless ninth of july bonds which were issued in lieu of cash payments to public employees and government contractors the economy again slipped into severe recession the trade balance improved albeit the cost of depressed business investment later career and the rise of maría julia out of power after the election of dr arturo illia in alsogaray devoted himself to undermining the new administration even during the vigorous economic recovery that followed finding allies in conservative business and media interests the powerful roman catholic church and his influential brother julio alsogaray and other illia opponents were successful following the coup against president illia he was designated ambassador to the united states post he held until alsogaray founded the new force in though like the independent civic party it fared poorly in the elections that returned perón to power he was among the few conservative figures to publicly oppose the imminent march coup but largely supported the subsequent national reorganization process as the dictatorship eventually yielded to calls for elections he founded the union of the democratic centre ucedé in running as right wing economically conservative candidate on the latter ticket he stood for the presidency in and alsogaray received two million votes in his presidential bid behind only major party candidates carlos menem and eduardo angeloz continuing to enjoy measure of support in buenos aires affluent northside he and his daughter maría julia alsogaray were elected the only two national deputies for the ucedé in and he served until vehement anti peronist and anti socialist alsogaray forged an alliance with the late juan perón justicialist party in following their nomination of pro market governor carlos menem and endorsed justicialist candidate eduardo vaca that year in tightly contested seat in the argentine senate representing the city of buenos aires argentine senators were indirectly elected at the time and alsogaray endorsement in the electoral college gave vaca the seat despite the latter coming in second to centrist ucr candidate fernando de la rúa the universidad francisco marroquín granted alsogaray an honorary doctorate in vocal supporter of the era privatizations he prevailed on president menem to appoint his daughter maría julia secretary of the environment in which post she served from to and himself served in numerous consultative posts during the menem presidency endorsing the populist turned conservative president in his re election bid among his most notable roles in this era was as director of feasibility study in for the replacement of buenos aires two international airports for an island terminal on the río de la plata opposed by de la rúa who had been elected mayor and would later be president the project never materialized his ucedé party languished despite his renewed influence as much due to public mistrust of his policies as because of rivalries in the party itself notably between his daughter and adelina alessio de viola whom he had menem appoint as head of the national mortgage bank commenting on the dispute he remarked that would it that one political party could do without affiliates or women legacy alsogaray who perennially sought television airtime lived out his last few years in seclusion he lost his wife in and died in buenos aires the following year at the age of adamantly conservative he was of the opinion that if anything the dictatorship was too moderate he felt that some of the most brutal torturers during dirty war such as alfredo astiz were heroes and even once

      "basement before tidyingbasement after tidying professional organizing is an industry that developed in in los angeles california to help individuals and businesses design organizing systems and processes to improve quality of life personal productivity and greater efficiency there are approximately professional organizers and productivity consultants who are members of the professional association the national association of productivity and organizing professionals napo beginning in number of television programs aired on the subject life laundry was followed by others such as clean sweep neat mission organization hoarding buried alive hoarders clean house and neattv as well as magazines like real simple origins of the professional organizing profession karen shortridge an entrepreneur who in the early began organizing residential spaces for friends and family was featured in local los angeles newspaper in the story concluded with an announcement for meeting for women who like to organize taking place later in the week ostensibly the purpose of gathering of women who like to organize was social in nature more like kaffee klatsch to talk about children and grandchildren recipes husbands and homemaking but two of the women in attendance maxine ordesky and stephanie culp had other ideas having no interest in discussing wet diapers instead they envisioned group devoted to business building at the time both women were self employed entrepreneurs maxine began her business the creative organizer in the early stephanie culp began organizing prior to her first company the grinning idiot an all purpose errand company with the tag line nothing is too moronic or mundane brought her into contact with her first organizing client asking for change to the meeting format the room quickly divided those who wanted to keep it social stayed behind in the boardroom at the bank maxine stephanie and ann gambrell retired registered nurse had been teaching classes on organizing homes and offices for an adult education program and wrote an organizing column for the daily breeze newspaper in torrance ca few short weeks later ann maxine and stephanie were joined by beverly clower and jeanne schorr for meeting in beverly living room as the group coalesced structurally and and as the women began marketing their services for paid work it became clear that to the outside world organizers were glorified housekeepers or maids stephanie culp made compelling argument to add the word professional to the women work as organizers description that seemed outlandish at first but which eventually overcame the housekeeper perception and opened the starting gate to actually attracting clients the women agreed to the new terminology and the association of professional organizers apo was formed apo filed for non profit status with the intention of women helping women they established policies for chapters then personally managed the launch of the first four chapters los angeles san diego san francisco and new york city with the founding of the new york chapter in the five women created the national association of professional organizers napo that year from august to september the intrepid pioneers formalized the association by electing officers formulating dues and holding elections as meetings became monthly the group expanded from living rooms to conference rooms and movement began maxine ordesky founding president presided over apo then napo through the first five years she recalls we met in small conference room located off corridor in local mall in west los angeles at that first meeting stood up in front of women not realizing in my wildest dreams that the organizing profession would grow to thousands of members worldwide the first napo conference was held in one of the break out rooms in los angeles at the universal sheraton hotel seemingly impossible idea as stephanie culp reminds us ann gambrell recalled we didn have mailing list but we needed to fill seats we didn want to be embarrassed with low turnout so we invited our friends and husbands to help fill the room beverly clower described those early years as important to her own professional development all these women had found their special niche and we were all like sisters in this together women need to be heard and here we were our clients and our colleagues were listening to us because we had something valuable to say golden circle the first code of ethics and status just to name few of the many ideas programs and policies that originated with the founders the founders as clower culp gambrell ordesky and schorr are fondly referred by napo members started with notion that women could be in business using skills that many of them already possessed they then developed that vision by building on it as team in time before computers they did everything by hand there was no funding available so they used their own money all this happened because five women had the courage and determination to take an idea that they believed in totally they became unstoppable founder stephanie culp is also the author of eight organizing books producing relevant content at time when only two other books were available stephanie winston getting organized and don aslett clutter last stand maxine ordesky the complete home organizer was published in

      "raider double eagle raider snowmobiles were produced by leisure vehicles inc from leisure vehicles inc was founded by bob bracey who had assisted in developing the legendary ford mark iv le mans race cars few years earlier while an engineer at kar kraft raider snowmobiles are unique for their use of rear mounted engine twin track design and cockpit seating all of which were revolutionary ideas for the snowmobile industry in the models the first production model year was though the sled had been in development since there were two models the raider and the roamer the raider featured single cylinder jlo stroke engine in the beginning of the model year but later may have switched to ccw the roamer featured hp briggs stratton cycle engine the production numbers are unknown but it is believed that approximately roamers and raiders were produced raiders and roamers featured twist grip throttle which was found to be hard to control in bumpy conditions the raider was significantly redesigned from the model year it was larger longer featured redesigned tracks longer skis and rear shocks along with the leaf sprung rear skids and many more raider specific manufactured parts for the model year there were four raider models the and the number represents the size of the ccw engine for each model the most common seem to be the cc followed by the cc this was probably due to engine availability most have electric starting some models have been found with hirth engines models are most often found with standard tachometer and models came standard with tach and speedometer there was limited production raider built in and intended for racing called the bandit production is thought to be around units all were put together at separate facility from the lvi factory it had lighter weight body front ski shocks the first time on raider and different hatch design that had air scoops instead of passenger seat the body is black and white and it has single wide white plastic snow flap with bandit lettered in black and black and white stripes on the front most bandits were built with hirth fan cooled twin cylinder engines but few have been found with ccw engines bandits were to be built in and models but at least one fan cooled hirth powered bandit has been found the hirth powered bandits have been found with twin carbs and two small round donaldson mufflers the bandits were intended for racing but were found to be too heavy to be competitive all were built by hand so each is little different the only bandit seen in raider advertising is in the background of one artists rendering of raider on snow in the raider snowmobile was again completely redesigned there were two models available in the tt and the tt the tt featured hp cc ccw engine no one knows why the tt is not called the tt or alternatively powered by cc engine it must heve been last minute change or the fact that the cc engine was more readily available the tt featured hp cc ccw engine there are also few raiders that have been found with older style cc ccw engines in the stripped down version that would be called the hawk in the engine on the design was tilted to allow for the longer intake on the newer ccw engines with larger carburetor this had the added benefit of lowering the center of gravity and reducing vibration the raider snowmobiles experienced few revisions from the model the biggest changes were revised graphics on the snowmobile the model year also marked the change of the raider lineup into three distinct models the hawk eagle and double eagle most eagle raiders are actually unsold raider tt and tt model inventory many raiders had gone unsold due to industry wide overproduction poor snow in most of the midwest and the opec oil embargo raider dealers were sent an upgrade kit with new style decals the black front applique and new owner manual the dealer service bulletin reminded dealers to be sure to remove the owner manual replace it with the owner manual the hawk was stripped down raider model it had no gauges no electric start no front ski shocks no brake lights no hinged gas door cover and no passenger seat it came equipped with cc ccw engine with the raider style smaller intake and carburator and raider wiring and chrome brake and throttle controls and the style dash mounted toggle light and high beam switch the hawk seems to have been way for lvi to use up left over raider parts and at the same time have cheaper entry level sled the double eagle was again completely new redesigned sled it was slightly larger and used more advanced coil sprung rear suspension technology than the hawk and eagle models it also featured an injection molded body hatch and pan and wider front ski stance this final redesign was intended to reduce the total number of parts needed to build the machine and therefore speed up production the model year was to see the end of raider production very few raider snowmobiles were manufactured and included revised double eagle that was now burnt orange as opposed to harvest gold as seen in the eagle that was now light blue and powered by cc engine there was no eagle bird decal on the light blue though they are still known as the eagle for some reason all raiders were now powered by kohler as fan cooled twin cylinder engines with cdi ignition john deere had negotiated an exclusive contract for ccw kioritz engines forcing lvi raider to find new engine source leisure vehicles had intended to create two person side by side raider designated as the twin eagle for but only few prototypes were built was tumultuous year for leisure vehicles due to poor snow season increasing emission and noise level restrictions the departure of bob bracey from the company and an industry wide shake out and contraction as result of these problems and many others the company halted production on the raider bob bracey said that total raider production was about units external links american snowmobiler

      "the battle of saltanovka also known as the battle of mogilev french bataille de mogilev was battle during the early stages of the french invasion of russia russian soldiers backed by artillery pieces under prince pyotr bagration and general lieutenant nikolay raevsky attacked french troops and guns of marshal louis nicolas davout at and near the village of saltanovka south of mogilev on july all russian attacks were repulsed with heavy losses through superior french infantry and artillery firepower french casualties amounted to men while the russians lost davout victory prevented the russian second western army under bagration from joining the first western army of barclay de tolly at vitebsk but could not stop bagration from effecting the link up later at smolensk prelude avoiding french envelopment attempts at the beginning of the invasion the russian second western army under prince pyotr bagration was ordered on july to join via mogilev the first western army of barclay de tolly bagration was threatened with encirclement by french emperor napoleon forces under king jerome to the west and marshal louis nicolas davout corps to the north the russian prince moved rapidly to cross the dnieper river at mogilev to link up with barclay davout was faster however and of his troops took mogilev on july the russians arrived before mogilev on july and their vanguard under colonel vasily sysoev drove out davout forward detachments near the village of dashkovka to the south of mogilev opposing forces russian bagration had men available but assigned only general nikolay raevsky strong vii corps to attack davout bagration order was essentially for an aggressive reconnaisance in force depending on the strength of the french raevsky would either drive the french out and capture orsha thereby covering the first western army crossing of the dnieper or delay them long enough for bagration to cross south of mogilev french weakened by the transferal of his troops elsewhere and fatigue davout had effectives on hand at mogilev including infantry and cavalry in three infantry division under generals jean dominique compans joseph marie dessaix and michel marie claparède and cavalry under generals étienne de bordesoule and valence davout deployed his forces at saltanovka naturally strong position the left flank was covered by the bogs of the dnieper stream ran through ravine across his front with bridge inside saltanovka the village itself was surrounded by forests davout constructed earthworks to strengthen his line fortified the buildings on the main road and set up artillery batteries the bridge at fatova was destroyed battle initial stages at on july vii corps advance guard of two jäger battalions under colonel andre glebov drove out davout outposts on the french left flank by the bridge on the left was in russian hands and the jäger continued their advance davout deployed the th line regiment for counterattack backed by artillery the russian attack failed as crushing french artillery and infantry firepower mowed down the unprotected russian infantry who died where they stood rather than break for cover while the russian attack was faltering bagration sent raevsky new order to storm mogilev fatova the th infantry division under ivan paskevich assaulted fatova in extended column formation forcing to retreat davout sent battalion of the th line regiment and some artillery to help out the two french battalions redeployed on the heights south of fatova and defeated the russian attacks backed by guns paskevich opened another assault that bashed through the french defenders to take the village past fatova davout had prepared an ambush with four battalions from the th line lying low amidst the wheat fields behind the village the concealed french troops launched devastating counterattack that caused heavy losses on the russians and threw them back in disarray fatova was recaptured by the french paskevich attacked and captured the village again davout now moved forward the st line from his reserve all russian attacks were repulsed and on the right two french battalions overran the nizhniy novgorod and orlov regiments crossing the stream paskevich deployed the poltava regiment to prevent his right flank from being enveloped saltanovka the russian attack main point of effort was saltanovka raevsky personally led the smolensk infantry regiment to capture dam and shield the attack of his main force the th and nd jäger regiments would act as support along with artillery on both sides of the main road paskevich assault on fatova would take place at the same time raevsky blundered however not hearing the agreed upon artillery fire that would signal the advance his own attack started too late french artillery inflicted huge losses on raevsky men raevsky personally led charge allegedly with his and year old sons nikolai and aleksandr although raevsky denied it but the attempt failed regardless french prisoners informed raevsky that french reinforcements were on the way bagration ordered full retreat to dashkovka davout attacked the russian rearguard later that day but did not achieve result aftermath the second western army constructed bridge south of mogilev at novy bikhov and crossed the dnieper toward smolensk the battle prevented bagration from joining the first western army under barclay de tolly at vitebsk forcing bagration to retreat to smolensk saltanovka is generally seen as french victory but despite failing to link up with barclay at vitebsk bagration accomplished his objective of joining the main russian force later at smolensk and avoided napoleon encirclement casualties the russian losses were men killed and wounded although marshal davout officially declared that they lost dead and wounded davout admitted to only casualties which include prisoners from the th line regiment and were officially reported by him the russians claimed french casualties of killed wounded and missing actual french losses were about footnotes references pigeard alain dictionnaire des batailles de napoléon tallandier bibliothèque napoléonienne\n",

and martial then emperor wu of wu 吳武帝 with the temple name of taizu 太祖 was military governor jiedushi of huainan circuit 淮南 headquartered in modern yangzhou jiangsu late in the chinese tang dynasty whose takeover of huainan and several nearby circuits allowed him and his family to rule over territory that would eventually become the five dynasties and ten kingdoms state wu although yang xingmi would be the first ruler in his line to receive the title of prince of wu it was tang bestowed title and did not denote independence of the state including most of modern jiangsu and anhui and parts of modern jiangxi and hubei background yang xingmin was born in during the reign of emperor xuānzong of tang he was from lu prefecture 廬州 in modern hefei anhui his ancestors including his father yang fu 楊怤 were farmers for generations in youth tian jun and he became close friends and they came to refer to each other as brother it was said that he was physically strong in his youth and during the qianfu era of emperor xuānzong grandson emperor xizong yang xingmin became bandit he was captured but the prefect of lu prefecture zheng qi was impressed by his appearance and stated to him you will be rich and honored one day why be bandit zheng then released him yang later became soldier of the lu prefecture militia and he distinguished himself in battles however as result his commander was apprehensive of him and persuaded then prefect lang youfu 郎幼復 to send yang on an away mission when yang subsequently met his commander to bid farewell and the commander wanting to pretend to favor yang asked yang what favors yang would want him to do if any yang responded need your head and then killed him yang then took control of the militia and declared himself the commander lang was unable to control him and so submitted report to gao pian the military governor jiedushi of huainan circuit which lu prefecture belonged to recommending that gao commission yang the new prefect to replace lang himself gao agreed and emperor xizong subsequently at gao recommendation issued such commission as prefect of lu prefecture also in two of gao pian officers yu gongchu 俞公楚 and yao guiili 姚歸禮 failed in an assassination attempt against gao favored sorcerer lü yongzhi who had in effect taken over huainan governance due to gao trust in him lü thus made accusations against them and gao sent them out to combat agrarian rebels lü then secretly informed yang falsely that yu and yao intent was to attack lu prefecture yang responded by laying an ambush for yu and yao killing them and then informing gao that they had planned mutiny gao not knowing that lü put this incident into motion rewarded yang for putting down the mutiny in when gao nephew gao yu 高澞 then the prefect of nearby shu prefecture 舒州 in modern anqing anhui came under the attack of the local agrarian rebel chen ru 陳儒 gao yu sought aid from yang yang did not have enough soldiers to respond but sent his officer li shenfu who tricked chen into believing that large army was arriving from lu as result chen fled subsequently when qin zongquan who was previously the tang military governor of fengguo circuit 奉國 headquartered in modern zhumadian henan but who had rebelled against tang by this point sent brother to attack lu yang sent tian jun to repel qin attack meanwhile when other agrarian rebels wu jiong 吳迥 and li ben 李本 attacked shu gao yu abandoned it and was subsequently executed by gao pian yang then sent his officers tao ya 陶雅 and zhang xun 張訓 to attack wu and li after tao and zhang subsequently captured and executed wu and li yang commissioned tao as the prefect of shu in by which point the prefects of huainan appeared to be attacking each other at will to enlarge their spheres of influence zhang ao 張翱 the prefect of shou prefecture 壽州 in modern lu an anhui sent his officer wei qian 魏虔 to attack lu yang sent tian li shenfu and zhang xun to resist and they repelled wei attack meanwhile though xu qing 許勍 the prefect of chú prefecture 滁洲 in modern chuzhou anhui attacked shu tao was unable to resist and fled back to lu allowing xu to take shu also in under gao order for reasons unclear yang changed his name from xingmin to xingmi war for control of huainan circuit war against qin yan and bi shiduo in gao pian officer bi shiduo fearing that lü yongzhi would have him killed rebelled and put huainan capital yang prefecture 揚州 under siege lü who then had fallout with gao himself as gao wanted to compromise with bi while lü opposed sent yang xingmi an order in gao name requesting that he come to yang prefecture aid yang under the advice of his strategist yuan xi 袁襲 decided to act he gathered his own forces and requested additional forces from sun duan 孫端 the prefect of neighboring he prefecture 和州 in modern chaohu anhui and headed for yang prefecture before he got there lü with gao and gao nephew gao jie 高傑 turning against him already fled yang prefecture and they rendezvoused at tianchang 天長 in modern chuzhou along with bi one time ally zhang shenjian 張神劍 who had turned against bi due to bi refusal to give him the spoils he wanted by this point bi who had received aid from qin yan the governor of xuanshe circuit 宣歙 headquartered in modern xuancheng anhui had offered the military governorship to qin so he informed zhang that any division of spoils had to await qin decision drawing zhang anger yang xingmi then took these joint forces and put yang prefecture under siege qin and bi initially defended the city against the siege but their attempts to counterattack were repelled by yang xingmi who inflicted heavy losses on their troops meanwhile under siege yang prefecture was running out of food supplies leaving to severe famine and cannibalism during the siege qin put gao to death and yang xingmi responded by great display of mourning after several months yang xingmi unable to capture the city considered withdrawing but one night lü former subordinate zhang shenwei 張審威 opened the city gates and allowed yang xingmi forces in qin and bi fled allowing yang xingmi to capture the city he claimed the title of acting military governor while putting lü and several other officers whose loyalty he considered suspect to death including zhang shenjian however by this point qin zongquan general sun ru had arrived in the vicinity having been sent earlier in the year by qin zongquan to vie for control of huainan circuit when qin zongquan subsequently tried to recall sun sun killed qin zongquan brother qin zongheng 秦宗衡 who was theoretically the commander of the army and refused the recall effectively acting independently from this point on qin yan and bi joined forces with sun who immediately put up threatening posture against yang xingmi yuan believed that with yang xingmi forces worn out by the lengthy siege and the people of yang prefecture facing starvation yang xingmi was in no shape to confront sun he suggested that yang xingmi abandon the city yang xingmi agreed and he prepared for an evacuation and return to lu prefecture but did not carry it out immediately meanwhile the tang imperial government which was also weary of the developments at huainan circuit had commissioned zhu quanzhong the military governor of xuanwu circuit 宣武 headquartered in modern kaifeng henan the military governor of huainan as well zhu announced that he was making yang xingmi deputy military governor while announcing his own officer li fan 李璠 as acting military governor he sent his advisor zhang yanfan 張延範 to yang prefecture to convey his good will and decisions to yang xingmi yang xingmi initially welcomed zhang but upon hearing that zhu was sending li fan as acting military governor turned angry zhang in fear fled back to xuanwu meanwhile li fan on his way south was ambushed by shi pu the military governor of ganhua circuit 感化 headquartered in modern xuzhou jiangsu who was angry that zhu not he was given huainan with both yang xingmi and shi turning against him zhu abandoned his plans of taking control of huainan he subsequently recommended to the imperial government that yang be made acting military governor in spring sun who by this point had put qin yan and bi to death and taken over their forces finally attacked yang prefecture capturing it easily sun claimed the title of military governor yang xingmi fled and per yuan suggestion returned to lu prefecture to prepare his next step war against sun ru yang xingmi however believed that sun ru would eventually attack him and in fall he considered heading south to attack zhong chuan the military governor of zhennan circuit 鎮南 headquartered in modern nanchang jiangxi to try to take over zhong territory yuan xi however pointed out that zhong had possessed zhennan for years and was well prepared for an attack instead he suggested that yang attack zhao huang the governor of xuanshe who had been commissioned by qin yan when qin left xuanshe to head for huainan yang agreed and also persuaded sun duan and zhang xiong an independent general who was then at shangyuan 上元 in modern nanjing jiangsu to attack zhao as well with zhao main forces distracted by sun and zhang attacks yang was able to cross the yangtze river easily and put xuanshe capital xuan prefecture 宣州 under siege when zhao brother zhao qianzhi 趙乾之 the prefect of chi prefecture 池州 in modern chizhou anhui tried to come to aid zhao huang yang sent tao ya to face him and tao defeated him forcing him to flee to zhennan by with xuan prefecture running out of food zhao huang officer zhou jinsi 周進思 expelled him he tried to flee to yang prefecture but tian jun captured him after yang reported what occurred to emperor xizong brother and successor emperor zhaozong emperor zhaozong commissioned yang as the governor of xuanshe meanwhile zhu quanzhong who was an old friend of zhao huang sent emissaries to request that yang release zhao to him however yang accepting yuan suggestion that doing so might leave zhao as threat instead executed zhao and gave zhao head to zhu emissaries meanwhile he sent tian to attack chang prefecture 常州 in modern changzhou jiangsu then held by du leng 杜稜 subordinate of qian liu tian surprised du and captured him taking chang prefecture yang also sent ma jingyan 馬敬言 to capture run prefecture 潤州 in modern zhenjiang jiangsu and ma did so subsequently emperor zhaozong upgraded xuanshe to circuit with military governor renamed it ningguo and made yang its military governor yang then also sent li you 李友 to capture sū prefecture 蘇州 in modern suzhou jiangsu but subsequently sun ru attacked and took su killing li you yang officer an renyi 安仁義 who was then at run then abandoned run as well allowing sun to take run when sun attacked lu cai chou 蔡儔 whom yang had left in defense of lu also surrendered it to sun in spring sun pressed his attack repeatedly defeating an and tian pushing toward xuan prefecture it was said that the morale of yang army fell low in light of the defeats rebounding only somewhat after some successes by li shenfu and tai meng 臺濛 sun pushed forward to huangchi 黃池 in modern wuhu anhui and defeated yang officers liu wei 劉威 and zhu yanshou younger brother of yang wife lady zhu however sun army was thereafter stricken by flood forcing him to withdraw and return to yang prefecture he nevertheless was able to send his officers kang wang 康暀 and an jingsi 安景思 to capture he and chú prefectures respectively although li shenfu soon recaptured them subsequently yang and zhu quanzhong entered into an alliance against sun when sun heard this he decided that he would destroy yang first and then attack zhu he thus forced the mature men and women of yang prefecture across the yangtze to accompany his army while killing the old and the weak as sun left yang prefecture yang sent zhang xun and li decheng into yang prefecture to take control of the remaining food supplies in the city and to comfort those who escaped sun massacre effectively allowing him to take the city without fight sun subsequently surrounded yang xingmi at guangde 廣德 in modern xuancheng and yang xingmi only escaped through the efforts of his officer li jian 李簡 sun then advanced toward xuan prefecture yang xingmi sought aid from qian who then possessed the hang prefecture 杭州 in modern hangzhou zhejiang region qian did not launch troops but did aid yang army with food in spring with sun numerically superior army pressuring him yang considered abandoning xuan prefecture and withdrawing to tongguan 銅官 in modern tongling anhui liu li shenfu and dai yougui 戴友規 dissuaded him pointing out that sun believed that he could destroy yang quickly and therefore carried minimal amount of food and if yang could simply refuse to engage sun and wear sun army down he could be destroyed dai further persuaded yang to send the yang prefecture refugees who had fled to ningguo back to yang prefecture to settle down to try to see if that would cause sun army to miss yang prefecture meanwhile zhang and yang other officers also retook chang and run prefectures when shi pu also wanted to use this opportunity to advance south zhang and li decheng repelled his forces and further took chǔ prefecture 楚州 in modern huai an jiangsu note different tone from the prefecture in modern chuzhou by summer sun army had been worn down sufficiently that yang army was beginning to have successes and zhang cut off sun army food supply routes further sun army was suffering from diseases and sun himself was stricken with malaria with food supplies running low he sent his officers liu jianfeng and ma yin to the nearby countryside to pillage for food yang after hearing that sun had fallen ill made final attack against sun defeating him tian captured sun on the battlefield and yang executed sun sending his head to emperor zhaozong most of sun army surrendered to yang although liu jianfeng and ma yin took some of the remnants and advanced south they eventually reached the hunan region and took it over yang then marched victoriously to yang prefecture and made it his headquarters again while stationing tian at xuan prefecture and an renyi at run prefecture emperor zhaozong receiving yang report made him the military governor of huainan while making tian the acting military governor of ningguo and an the prefect of run rule over huainan and nearby territory early rule it was said that due to years of warfare huainan circuit was stripped of its population and wealth yang xingmi was frugal promoted farming decreased the tax burden and encouraged commerce with nearby circuits it was said that within several years huainan was restored to what it was before the war began he organized of sun ru soldiers who submitted to him into an elite corp known as the heiyun corps 黑雲都 and had them serve as his advance corps in battles against other circuits meanwhile although sun subordinates largely submitted to yang other than the escaped liu jianfeng and ma yin cai chou the prefect of lu prefecture who had previously been yang subordinate but had surrendered to sun started campaign to resist yang at lu prefecture along with ni zhang 倪章 the prefect of shu prefecture cai in order to show resolve dug open the graves of yang ancestors and further had an emissary offer his prefect seal to zhu quanzhong seeking aid from zhu zhu however despised cai for his treachery and refused to aid cai instead he informed yang of what cai had done yang thanked zhu and sent li shenfu to attack cai and commanded follow up army himself cai subordinate zhang hao surrendered to yang lu prefecture fell in fall and yang executed cai but refused to accept the suggestion that cai ancestral tombs be dug up stating because of what cai chou did the people under heaven despised him why should follow his example thereafter he also sent tian jun to attack she prefecture 歙州 in modern huangshan anhui when the people of she offered to surrender if yang would make tao ya who was known for kindness to the people prefect yang did so and she surrendered yang treated the imperially commissioned prefect pei shu with respect and sent him back to the imperial government meanwhile ni abandoned shu and fled and yang sent li shenfu to be its prefect in spring wu tao 吳討 the prefect of huang prefecture 黃州 in modern wuhan hubei which belonged to neighboring wuchang circuit 武昌 headquartered in modern wuhan submitted to yang when wuchang military governor du hong subsequently attacked huang yang sent zhu yanshou to aid wu tao starting years of warfare with wuchang wu subsequently offered to resign since he feared further attack from du yang then had ju zhang 瞿章 take over as prefect meanwhile the relationship between yang and zhu quanzhong also broke down over two disputes when an emissary of zhu insulted zhang jian 張諫 the prefect of si prefecture 泗州 in modern huai an zhang responded by submitting to yang and when yang sent his officer tang linghui 唐令回 to xuanwu capital bian prefecture 汴州 with large supply of tea to try to sell it for profit zhu had tang detained and seized all of the tea in spring yang submitted petition to emperor zhaozong accusing zhu of crimes requesting that emperor zhaozong order the military governors to the north to attack zhu with him emperor zhaozong court which was extremely weak by that point was not recorded as having taken any actions on yang petition yang subsequently attacked shou prefecture and captured it he made zhu yanshou its military prefect 團練使 tuanlianshi and zhu yanshou was subsequently able to beat back xuanwu counterattack and able to hold shou meanwhile dong chang the military governor of yisheng circuit 義勝 headquartered in modern shaoxing zhejiang had misjudged his strength and declared himself the emperor of new state of luoping 羅平 qian liu who carried the title of military governor of zhenhai circuit 鎮海 previously headquartered at run prefecture but now was headquartered at qian base hang prefecture who had previously been dong subordinate used this as the excuse to attack dong seeking to conquer dong yisheng circuit yang not wanting to see qian conquer dong tried to dissuade qian and also sent emissaries to dong urging him to immediately cancel any use of imperial title and resume offering tributes to emperor zhaozong qian would not relent in his attack however so yang sent tai meng to attack sū prefecture to divert qian attention while submitting petitions in dong defense however while yang who later went to su himself to command the siege was able to capture su additional attacks by tian and an renyi against other officers of qian were repelled and qian attacks against dong did not abate by summer dong was forced to surrender to qian who executed him and took over yisheng which was subsequently renamed zhendong meanwhile qian du hong and zhong chuan all fearing that they would be the

the field soldiers from tianping taining and hedong their field fighting capabilities were greatly improved li keyong subsequently sent emissaries to yang requesting that shi and li chengsi be returned to him yang agreed but as yang treated shi and li chengsi well and awarded them with much treasure neither shi nor li chengsi actually ever returned to hedong and they served huainan thereafter later in spring yang resumed his attacks against wuchang at du request for assistance zhu quanzhong sent his adoptive son zhu yougong 朱友恭 to attack huang prefecture ju zhang abandoned huang in response to zhu yougong attack but was subsequently captured by zhu yougong meanwhile zhu quanzhong having conquered tianping and taining decided to make huainan his next target so he gathered his

impressive force underestimated yang xingmi army yang xingmi had zhu jin serve as his advance commander and zhu constructed dam on the huai river when yang xingmi attacked pang zhu released the waters to flood pang army and then attacked pang with yang pang army was crushed by the waters and the huainan forces and pang was killed zhu yanshou also defeated ge army hearing that both of his generals had been defeated zhu quanzhong also retreated this battle thus affirmed yang control of the territory between the huai and the yangtze rivers in spring qian liu zhong chuan du hong and wang shifan the military governor of pinglu circuit 平盧 headquartered in modern weifang shandong all submitted petitions to emperor zhaozong requesting that the imperial government declare general campaign against

with yang similarly cui hong 崔洪 the military governor of fengguo circuit vassal of zhu also had secret communications with yang and when zhu discovered this zhu sent zhang cunjing 張存敬 to attack cui cui warded off the attack by sending his brother cui xian 崔賢 to zhu as hostage and promised to contribute soldiers to zhu campaigns subsequently when zhu sent cui xian back to fengguo and demanded

believing the rumors to be true and believing that this would be his opportunity to seize qian capital hang prefecture he sent li shenfu to attack qian zhenhai circuit qian sent his general gu quanwu 顧全武 to resist but li shenfu defeated and captured him however li soon realized that qian had not been assassinated and that he would not be able to capture more of qian territory to ward off qian counterattack he who had captured qian hometown lin an 臨安 in modern hangzhou by this point protected qian ancestral tombs and allowed gu whom qian valued greatly to write home he also pretended large huainan reinforcement was on the way after extracting large amount of monetary award from qian he then withdrew yang later returned gu to zhenhai in return for qin pei 秦裴 huainan officer who was captured when qian recaptured sū prefecture by late the powerful palace eunuchs upon learning of plot between emperor zhaozong and the chancellor cui yin to slaughter them planned to kill cui in response cui summoned zhu quanzhong to the imperial capital chang an with an army upon hearing of zhu impending arrival the eunuchs led by han quanhui seized emperor zhaozong and fled to the domain of

sheng prefecture 昇州 shangyuan after zhang death who had an impressive fleet because of his fleet feng had refused to submit to yang tian built fleet himself in preparation and feng decided to preempt him by attacking ningguo capital xuan prefecture with his fleet despite yang sending messengers to urge him not to when feng engaged tian however tian defeated him and crushed his fleet feng in light of his defeat considered heading east out onto the east china sea but yang persuaded him that he would be treated well if he submitted to yang feng did so and yang commissioned him as deputy military governor of huainan yang then sent li shenfu to serve as the prefect of sheng with the feng threat over yang launched his attack on zhu domain leaving li chengsi in charge at huainan headquarters however his army ran into food supply problems as the large ships that he used to ship food supplies got stuck in the canals xu wen had suggested supplying the army with small ships instead to no avail but after this incident yang began to value xu advice and began to promote him subsequently when the huainan army attacked but could not capture sù prefecture quickly yang withdrew with yang campaign having failed by li maozhen was forced to kill han and other eunuchs who followed han and surrender emperor zhaozong to zhu to sue for peace zhu subsequently slaughtered the remaining eunuchs

their initial attempt failed they enticed tian from coming to their aid when tian arrived at hang prefecture he put it under siege and offered that if qian would surrender it he would be allowed to withdraw to zhendong circuit without further pursuit from tian qian refused and under gu suggestion decided to enlist yang aid in stopping tian who was still yang vassal at this point he sent gu with his son qian chuanliao 錢傳璙 to huainan as emissaries gu pointed out to yang that if tian captured zhenhai his power would increase greatly and would threaten yang instead he offered that if yang would order tian to withdraw qian liu would leave qian chuanliao as hostage yang accepted the proposal and gave daughter to qian chuanliao in marriage yang subsequently ordered tian to withdraw threatening

hostage in spring yang sent li shenfu assisted by liu you 劉有 to attack du hong wuchang circuit meanwhile wang shifan who had similarly received an edict from emperor zhaozong to attack zhu during the fengxiang siege and who had acted on it was now facing the overwhelming attack of zhu and he sought aid from yang yang sent wang maozhang to aid him and launched an attack on sù prefecture but soon withdrew his attack from sù in addition while wang maozhang initially had successes in conjunction with wang shifan in repelling the xuanwu attack soon wang maozhang determining that it would be impossible to indefinitely hold off the xuanwu attack withdrew from pinglu leaving wang shifan without further aid by winter wang shifan was forced to resubmit to zhu meanwhile it was said that tian had become deeply resentful against yang for forcing him to abandon zhenhai his resentment was furthered when he went to yang prefecture to meet yang xingmi to request that chi and she prefecture both of which had previously belonged to ningguo be returned to ningguo and yang refused in summer tian and an renyi who was then still at run prefecture as its military prefect together rose in rebellion against yang they eventually enticed zhu yanshou who was then at shou prefecture and who carried the title of military governor of fengguo to join them as well although zhu yanshou did not initially publicly state his intentions and sent emissaries to zhu quanzhong who also postured to attack huainan to aid them in face of the threat yang recalled li shenfu who had been attacking wuchang to attack tian and sent wang maozhang and xu wen to attack an yang realizing that zhu yanshou was about to turn against him pretended to have suffered stroke and stated to his wife lady zhu that he would be entrusting the headquarters to zhu yanshou she wrote zhu yanshou relaying yang remarks yang then summoned zhu yanshou to yang prefecture believing yang sincerity zhu yanshou went and was seized and executed by yang who then also executed zhu yanshou brothers and divorced lady zhu meanwhile li shenfu had initial successes against tian officers wang tan 王壇 and wang jian 汪建 tian therefore decided

power in the south vanni as well as in the north it is said that he lived in kumulamunai which is today in mullaitivu district history vanniar chieftain pandara vanniyan appeared to have paid some tribute to the more powerful rulers in the region at that time who had an independent spirit and distinct culture and dialect of their own the kingdom of vanni functioned as buffer zone between the north and the south of sri lanka historically the vanni encompassed mannar vavuniya trincomalee polonnaruwa batticaloa ampara and puttalam hinterlands the name vanni is said to be derived from the

attacked the government house in mullaitheevu and drove out the garrison from mullaitheevu which was under the command of captain edward mudge of the th regiment before finally seizing the fort he

      "jesus of nazareth is the central figure of christianity christians believe that he was and still is divine while islam considers him to have been prophet messenger and the messiah since the time in which he is said to have lived number of noted individuals have criticised jesus some of whom were themselves christians early critics of jesus and christianity included celsus in the second century and porphyry in the third in the th century friedrich nietzsche was highly critical of jesus whose teachings he considered to be anti nature in their treatment of topics such as sexuality more contemporary notable critics of jesus include ayn rand hector avalos sita ram goel christopher hitchens bertrand russell and dayananda saraswati criticism by jesus contemporaries pharisees and scribes the pharisees and scribes criticized jesus and his disciples for not observing mosaic law they criticized his disciples for not washing their hands before eating the religious leaders engaged in ceremonial cleansing like washing up to the elbow and baptizing the cups and plates before eating food in them jesus is also criticized for eating with the publicans the pharisees also criticized jesus disciples for gathering grain on the sabbath magic and exorcism in the latter half of the first century and into the second century jewish and pagan opponents of christianity argued that the miracles and exorcisms of jesus and his followers were the result of magic criticism by theme slavery avery robert dulles held the opinion that jesus though he repeatedly denounced sin as kind of moral slavery said not word against slavery as social institution and believes that the writers of the new testament did not oppose slavery either in his paper published in evangelical quarterly kevin giles notes that jesus often encountered slavery but not one word of criticism did the lord utter against slavery giles points to this fact as being used as an argument that jesus approved of slavery in certain major non english translations the first statement in the first sermon of jesus luke is call to free the slaves the spirit of the lord is on me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the slaves from war see cornilescu translation criticism by author celsus celsus nd century greek philosopher and opponent of early christianity mounts wide criticism against jesus as the founder of the christian faith he discounts or disparages jesus ancestry conception birth childhood ministry death resurrection and continuing influence according to celsus jesus ancestors came from jewish village his mother was poor country girl who earned her living by spinning cloth he worked his miracles by sorcery and was small homely man this rabbi jesus kept all jewish customs including sacrifice at the temple in jerusalem he gathered only few followers and taught them his worst habits including begging for money these disciples amounting to ten boatmen and couple of tax collectors were not respectable the reports of his resurrection came from hysterical female and belief in the resurrection was the result of jesus sorcery and the crazed thinking of his followers all for the purpose of impressing others and increasing the chance for others to become beggars according to celsus jesus was the inspiration for skulking rebels who deserve persecution celsus stated that jesus was the bastard child of the roman soldier panthera or pantera these charges of illegitimacy are the earliest datable statement of the jewish charge that jesus was conceived as the result of adultery see jesus in the talmud and that his true father was roman soldier named panthera panthera was common name among roman soldiers of that period the name has some similarity to the greek adjective parthenos meaning virgin the tomb of roman soldier named tiberius julius abdes pantera found in bad kreuznach germany is taken by some scholars to refer to the pantera named by celsus according to celsus jesus had no standing in the hebrew bible prophecies and talk of his resurrection was foolishness porphyry of tyre the neoplatonist philosopher porphyry of tyre authored the volume treatise against the christians proscribed by the emperors constantine and theodosius ii of which only fragments now survive and were collected by adolf von harnack selected fragments were published in english translation by stevenson in of which the following is one example even supposing some greeks are so foolish as to think that the gods dwell in the statues even that would be much purer concept of religion than to admit that the divine power should descend into the womb of the virgin mary that it became an embryo and after birth was wrapped in rags soiled with blood and bile and even worse friedrich nietzsche nietzsche considered jesus teachings to be unnatural friedrich nietzsche th century philosopher has many criticisms of jesus and christianity even going so far as to style himself as the anti christ in human all too human and twilight of the idols for example nietzsche accuses the church and jesus teachings as being anti natural in their treatment of passions in particularly sexuality there in the sermon on the mount it is said for example with particular reference to sexuality if thy eye offend thee pluck it out fortunately no christian acts in accordance with this precept the christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises nietzsche does explicitly consider jesus as mortal and furthermore as ultimately misguided the antithesis of true hero whom he posits with his concept of dionysian hero nietzsche was repulsed by jesus elevation of the lowly everything pitiful everything suffering from itself everything tormented by base feelings the whole ghetto world of the soul suddenly on top however nietzsche did not demur of jesus saying he was the only one true christian he presented christ whose own inner life consisted of blessedness in peace in gentleness in the inability for enmity there is much criticism by nietzsche of the organized institution of christianity and its class of priests christ evangelism consisted of the good news that the kingdom of god is within you what are the glad tidings true life eternal life is found it is not promised it is here it is within you as life lived in love sin every kind of distancing relationship between god and man is abolished precisely this is the glad tidings the glad tidings are precisely that there are no more opposites dayanand saraswati dayananda saraswati th century philosopher and the founder of arya samaj in his book satyarth prakash criticized christianity and described jesus as great thing in country of uneducated savages all christian missionaries say that jesus was very calm and peace loving person but in reality he was hot tempered person destitute of knowledge and who behaved like wild savage this shows that jesus was neither the son of god nor had he any miraculous powers he did not possess the power to forgive sins the righteous people do not stand in need of any mediator like jesus jesus came to spread discord which is going on everywhere in the world therefore it is evident that the hoax of christ being the son of god the knower of the past and the future the forgiver of sin has been set up falsely by his disciples in reality he was very ordinary ignorant man neither learned nor yogi saraswati asserted that jesus wasn an enlightened man either and that if jesus was son of god god would have saved him at the time of his death and he wouldn have suffered from severe mental and physical pain at last moments noting that the bible writes that women held the feet of jesus and worshiped him he questions was it the same body which had been buried now that body had been buried for three days we should like to know why did it not decompose bertrand russell in the essay why am not christian russell pointed to parts of the gospel where jesus is saying that his second coming will occur in the lifetime of some of his listeners he concludes from this that jesus prediction was incorrect and thus that jesus was not so wise as some other people have been and he was certainly not superlatively wise though russell believed jesus had very high degree of moral goodness he also felt there were some notable flaws in his character in his essay he wrote there is one very serious defect to my mind in christ moral character and that is that he believed in hell do not myself feel that any person who is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment christ certainly as depicted in the gospels did believe in everlasting punishment and one does find repeatedly vindictive fury against those people who would not listen to his preaching an attitude which is not uncommon with preachers but which does somewhat detract from superlative excellence you do not for instance find that attitude in socrates you find him quite bland and urbane toward the people who would not listen to him and it is to my mind far more worthy of sage to take that line than to take the line of indignation russell also expresses doubt over the historical existence of jesus and questions the morality of religion say quite deliberately that the christian religion as organized in its churches has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world ayn rand novelist and philosopher ayn rand denounced the altruist recipe that jesus passed down to his pupils and with it the idea of vicarious redemption she thought that not even christians who think of jesus in the highest possible terms shouldn feel outraged by the notion of sacrificing virtue to vice not surprisingly her understanding of love as consequence of the rational mind looking after embodied values attributes evil to the ideas jesus is most famous for consider the following excerpt from interview conducted by mike wallace wallace christ every important moral leader in man history has taught us that we should love one another why then is this kind of love in your mind immoral rand it is immoral if it is love placed above oneself it is more than immoral it impossible because when you are asked to love everybody that is to love people without any standard to love them regardless of whether they have any value or virtue you are asked to love nobody notwithstanding disagreements over the value of faith and the existence of an afterlife rand saw jesus insistence on procuring the eternal happiness of individuals as confirmation of the moral confusion and inconsistency in which much of religious ethics operates including christian altruism in for the new intellectual rand further accuses judeo christian tenets such as the doctrine of original sin for their conspicuous immorality the evils for which they damn him man are reason morality creativeness joy all the cardinal values of his existence it is not his vices that their myth of man fall is designed to explain and condemn they call it morality of mercy and doctrine of love for man and proceeds to charge religious leaders with fostering death cult no they say they do not preach that man is evil the evil is only that alien object his body no they say they do not wish to kill him they only wish to make him lose his body sita ram goel historian and hindu activist sita ram goel accused jesus of being the intellectual author behind western imperialism and the holocaust goel further writes that jesus is no more than an artifice for legitimizing wanton imperialist aggression he does not symbolize spiritual power or moral uprightness he made his case based on the gospels which he thought cast too dark shadow on unconverted jews see for instance from there he drew parallels between jesus and adolf hitler the latter of whom was in goel words the first to completely grasp the verdict passed on the jews by the jesus of the gospels ram goel also ridiculed what he termed the cult of the disentangled christ whereby christian revisionism attempts to salvage the figure of jesus from the atrocious historical outcomes he inspired and only from the bad ones as though missionary proselytism and western expansionism were to be perceived in the separate as mere coincidence christopher hitchens hitchens author and journalist christopher hitchens one of the leading exponents in the new atheism movement was extremely critical of jesus christianity and any religion in general regarding jesus teachings on hell hitchens wrote the god of moses would call for other tribes including his favorite one to suffer massacre and plague and even extirpation but when the grave closed over his victims he was essentially finished with them unless he remembered to curse their succeeding progeny not until the advent of the prince of peace do we hear of the ghastly idea of further punishing and torturing the dead hitchens also felt that divine jesus would be the more morally problematic by virtue of the problem of evil asking if jesus could heal blind person he happened to meet then why not heal blindness sam harris sam harris author of the end of faith has expressed ambivalent views on jesus teachings he argues that while jesus may have been an insightful spiritual master of compassion at times he also taught his followers to fulfill the barbaric law of the old testament and gave his followers specifics on how to execute heretics to harris jesus unresolved frustration and hatred of non christians runs contrary to the imagination of contemporary religious moderates and actually lends honesty to more fundamentalist interpretations of salvation and hell he wrote in addition to demanding that we fulfill every jot and tittle of old testament law jesus seems to have suggested in john further refinements to the practice of killing heretics and unbelievers if man abide not in me he is cast forth as branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned whether we want to interpret jesus metaphorically is of course our business the problem with scripture however is that many of its possible interpretations including most of the literal ones can be used to justify attrocities in defense of the faith to the same end of exposing jesus in relation to the doctrine of hell harris quotes luke version of the parable of the talents which ends with the nobleman character saying but those mine enemies which would not that should reign over them bring hither and slay them before me which is taken to be self portrait of jesus and his own eschatological views hector avalos hector avalos is perhaps the first openly atheist biblical scholar to write systematic critique of the ethics of jesus in his book the bad jesus the ethics of new testament ethics koowon kim an associate professor in the old testament at reformed graduate university in south korea remarks in his review of the bad jesus whether or not one agrees with the author conclusions this book is the first systematic challenge to new testament ethics by an atheist scholar firmly grounded in the hebrew bible and its ancient near eastern context and well versed in new testament and early christianity in review in bilbilcal theology bulletin sarah rollens new testament scholar at rhodes college remarks hector avalos aims not only to convince us that many portrayals of jesus based on new testament texts are morally or ethically problematic but also to demonstrate how scholars have engaged in questionable distortions to minimize explain away or otherwise ignore any textual evidence that might not comport with modern ethical standards criticism by other religions criticism in judaism judaism which includes orthodox judaism haredi judaism hasidic judaism reform judaism conservative judaism judaism karaite judaism and samaritan judaism entirely rejects the idea of jesus being god person of trinity or mediator to god who has special relationship with him that somehow makes jesus divine moreover it is avodah zarah foreign worship which means idolatry to regard or worship human being as god in judaism as well as in islam god is only one totally transcendent and cannot be human exodus deuteronomy judaism also holds that jesus couldn be the jewish messiah arguing that he had not fulfilled any of the messianic prophecies foretold in the tanakh nor did he embody the personal qualifications of the messiah foretold by the prophets according to jewish tradition there were no more prophets after malachi who lived centuries before jesus and delivered his prophecies about bce thus judaism is critical of jesus own claims and allusions about his alleged messiahship and his identification as the son of god as presented in the new testament and considers jesus to be just one of many individuals who claimed to be the messiah but didn fulfill any of the messianic prophecies therefore they were all impostors the mishneh torah one of the most authoritative works of jewish law written by moses maimonides provides the last established consensus view of the jewish community in hilkhot melakhim that jesus is

      "the minamata disease compensation agreements of were agreed between the polluting chisso company and representative groups of fishermen and minamata disease patients who had been affected by mercury pollution the agreements and their formation shared number of common characteristics they were formulated outside the legal system by ad hoc mediation committees specially established for the purpose members of the committees and the final agreements were weighted in favour of chisso and all included punitive clauses that the groups could make no future claims for compensation against the company compensation of fishermen ever since when chisso opened the factory in minamata wastewater had been dumped into the seas around minamata particularly into minamata bay via the waste canal outlet in hyakken harbour damage to fisheries was inevitable and the minamata fishing cooperative had demanded compensation from the company on two occasions previous to the outbreak of minamata disease after direct negotiations in the company agreed to pay sympathy money to the cooperative of jpy usd by using the term the company avoided accepting responsibility for the damage and sought to prevent further claims by including clause in the agreement that the cooperative would never again lodge complaints against chisso this pattern of denial of responsibility and the inclusion of punitive clauses repeated itself again and again in chisso dealings with complainants the pollution continued unabated and another agreement was signed in this time the cooperative was paid jpy in compensation for future and past damage to fishing the cooperative was also forced to acknowledge chisso importance to the prosperity of minamata and the need to cooperate so as not to harm its operations indicating the unequal nature of the agreement fishing in minamata bay smith the minamata fishing cooperative by the time of the outbreak of minamata disease the fishing situation had become critical from to the fish catch in minamata had declined by staggering in the kumamoto prefectural government had attempted to limit the spread of the disease by banning the sale of fish caught from minamata bay but did not issue and all out ban this left fishermen with fish they could not sell but no financial assistance to compensate their losses in september the minamata fishing cooperative petitioned the prefecture to ban fishing completely so that their members might be properly compensated under the fisheries law and food sanitation act the government did not respond and only advised the fishermen against consumption of the fish and shellfish they caught from the bay however with no source of income many fishermen were left with no choice but to eat the suspect fish they caught in fact throughout the history of the minamata disease problem the catching of fish from minamata bay has never been legally prohibited despite the ban on the sale of contaminated fish there was still widespread suspicion amongst local people that fish caught in the minamata area was unsafe and by june several fish shops had gone out of business from plummeting demand desperate and with no assistance from government the cooperative was forced into direct negotiations with the company on august members of the cooperative marched on the factory and in hostile atmosphere met with factory manager eiichi nishida the fishermen demand for the cleanup of minamata bay the installation of wastewater treatment facilities and jpy million usd was met with an offer of emergency sympathy money to the value of jpy usd and promise to consult with the company head office in tokyo fishermen from the cooperative again forced their way into the factory on august to continue negotiations no agreement could be reached but the two sides did manage to agree to joint inspection of fishing conditions in minamata bay followed by further talks on august after this inspection chisso admitted that fishing was impossible in some areas and made final offer of jpy million usd this paltry sum incensed the fishermen violence broke out riot police were called and nishida and other company employees were effectively held hostage in the factory building only after mayor todomu nakamura agreed to mediate between the two sides did the fishermen leave the factory grounds the mediation committee formed by mayor nakamura was stacked heavily in chisso favour and presented decision on august the company would pay jpy million usd directly to the cooperative and set up jpy million usd fund to promote the recovery of fishing the proposal was qualified with the ultimatum that if either side rejected the committee would stop mediation completely on august the fishing cooperative delivered its response in order to end the anxiety of the citizens we swallow our tears and accept the company also agreed and the first compensation agreement between chisso and fisherman was complete the kumamoto prefectural alliance of fishing cooperatives to the company disappointment this first agreement did not bring an end to problems with fishermen since chisso had switched the wastewater output from minamata bay to the mouth of minamata river in september the environmental damage had spread even further up and down the shiranui sea cats had started to die in ashikita to the north and in izumi to the south of minamata and new minamata disease patients were also appearing the pollution was having widespread effect on fishing catches and fish sales as people confidence in the safety of their food evaporated this drove the kumamoto prefectural alliance of fishing cooperatives to take action of similar pattern to that taken by the minamata fishing alliance earlier in the year but on larger scale on october fishermen from the alliance descended on the factory demanding direct negotiations with chisso when company officials refused the fishermen forced their way into the factory and attacked the security office breaking windows and injuring seven guards alliance president ushita murakami delivered their demands to company manager nishida who promised prompt reply when the response came the company said that since the factory waste had still not been proven as the cause of minamata disease and it could offer the fishermen nothing unsatisfied murakami and followers travelled to tokyo and met with officials of numerous government departments to outline their plight he managed to secure promise from members of the diet that they would visit minamata to investigate the situation when the diet party arrived in minamata on november they were met by crowd of demonstrators including fishermen and disease victims groups alike outside the municipal hospital the crowd was extremely respectful to the diet members and pleaded with them for help the members thanked the demonstrators for bringing the issue to the attention of the national government and promised they would do all they could emboldened after their demonstration at the hospital the alliance fishermen marched on the factory to again demand negotiations the company refused and the fishermen forced their way in and rioted attacking many buildings and significantly damaging company property riot police arrived and serious fighting continued sporadically for the rest of the day until the fishermen dispersed around pm injuries included fishermen two company employees factory manager nishida himself policemen and the chief of police damages to company property amounted to jpy million usd before the riot the minamata disease issue had been skirted by the national media and had been chiefly local issue the violent riot however was covered widely in the national media and for the first time since the discovery of the disease in the issue of minamata disease had nationwide coverage mediation committee headed by kumamoto prefecture governor hirosaku teramoto was formed to hammer out solution at meeting on december the prefectural fishing alliance outlined their demands compensation of jpy billion usd million for damage to fishing since the temporary closure of the factory and removal of toxic sludge the committee then met company executives including chisso president kiichi yoshioka who responded with an offer that amounted to nearly zero after weeks of wrangling the fishing alliance reduced its demands to jpy million usd million and chisso under increasing pressure from all sides relaxed its position the proposed agreement presented with the ultimatum of no further mediation from the committee should it be rejected as previously called for the immediate installation of wastewater treatment facilities jpy million compensation to be paid to the alliance jpy million of which would be deducted to cover the damage caused in the november riots and jpy million fund for the recovery of the fishing industry the agreement also included clause that the alliance could never demand further compensation even if the factory waste was proven to be the cause of the damage the agreement was accepted by both sides on december compensation of victims in the victims of minamata disease and their families were in much weaker position than the fisherman who had extracted at least some sympathy money from chisso the only patients organisation present at the time of the fishermen agreements was the minamata disease patients families mutual aid society which had only been established in august they were much fewer in number in november the society only represented the families of patients and the membership of the society was more divided than the relatively united fishermen one factor driving the division of the patients was the discrimination and ostracism some families were experiencing in the minamata community local people who were naturally averse to uncleanliness and disease felt that the company and their city that depended upon it was facing economic ruin under the pressure of the various groups making demands of it even fishermen who were fellow victims of the company pollution discriminated against disease victims because they were stoking fears that prevented the sale of their fish to some patients this ostracisim from the community represented greater fear than the disease itself in similar fashion to the fishermen associations the mutual aid society began by petitioning the city and prefectural governments and visited kumamoto city on november when their petitions produced no results the society approached chisso directly and demanded compensation of jpy million usd jpy million usd per person on november the company replied that the link between the factory wastewater and minamata disease had not been proven and could therefore offer them nothing but an expression of sympathy the society began sit in at the company gates which was to last whole month around members of the society travelled to kumamoto on december and made request to governor teramoto to include the patients request for compensation with the mediation that was ongoing with the prefectural fishing alliance he agreed to consult with the company and when the mediation committee presented its deal to the fishing alliance on december it also presented proposal for sympathy payments to the mutual aid society even though no representatives had been present on the mediation committee the proposal amounted to total compensation package of jpy million the money would be allocated to patients certified by committee to be established by the ministry of health and welfare as follows adult patients would receive jpy usd and children jpy usd per year families of dead patients would receive jpy usd payment society leader eizō watanabe agreed that the overall level of compensation was acceptable but rejected the plan over the staggered schedule of payments and the very small sum being offered for child victims the mediation committee reconvened on december and agreed to increase the child payments to jpy usd per child the mutual aid society held vote of its members but the agreement was rejected by single vote society leader watanabe offered his resignation in protest but when another vote was held on december members accepted the agreement and his resignation was withdrawn as usual the agreement did not admit responsibility for minamata disease the payments were sympathy money and the agreement included clause that even if in the future it is determined that the cause of minamata disease is the factory wastewater the patients will make absolutely no further demands for compensation along with an extra clause that if in the future it is determined that the cause of minamata disease is not the

retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory and the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken action assembly theory aat seeks to explain message behavior both verbal and nonverbal aat is communication theory that emphasizes psychological and social influences on human action the goal is to examine and describe the links between the cognition and behavior how an individuals thoughts get transformed into action according to the psychology wiki aat describes the production of behavior in two essential processes the retrieval of procedural elements from long term memory and the organization of these elements to form an output representation of action to be taken for example assembly is considered top to bottom process that begins with more general strategy and goes to more specific idea about communicating the specific message retrieval of procedural elements the idea of procedural record is at the center of action assembly these records contain information about action outcomes and situations these records are locked in the individual memory where it remembers past behaviors for the future procedural record is at the center of action assembly it is personal nugget of truth about past behavior stockpiled for future use part of an individual memory system in which information about how to execute various behaviors is stored procedural records contain information about action outcomes and situations for example traveling at excessive speed action in zone that specifies low speed limit situation can result in the issuance of ticket outcome procedural records have different levels of strength some are mere scratches that barely leave trace in the mind while others are well worn into long term memory central aspect of the action assembly theory is specifying the processes that link procedural records to behavioral representations the activation process is the process used to select particular procedural records for example if parent disciplined child for stealing all procedural records relevant to this goal and situation would be activated in turn if common disciplinary tactic was to take away toys and play items procedural record of that would be activated quickly organization of procedural elements it is also important to consider the process of assembly which organizes records into behavioral representation for example assembly is considered top down process that begins with general strategy and goes to more specific ideas about communicating the specific message action assembly theory has been useful for topics such as speech onset latency and hesitations during speaking these concepts are assumed to be indicators of cognitive processing another use is the study of planning individuals who plan more effectively are more fluent than those do not because planning reduces the cognitive load at the time of message production when an interaction situation has multiple goals the theory finds increased demands on an individual information processing capacity assembly of goals may be difficult because specific goals may be incompatible with behaviors associated with the other goals in turn multiple goal messages involve more speech hesitations and latencies the utilization of action assembly theory can provide clear opportunity to plan or assemble goals more careful to mitigate the

      "field marshal radomir putnik january may was the first serbian field marshal and chief of the general staff of the serbian army in the balkan wars and in the first world war he took part in all of the wars in which serbia took part between to family background and early career the putnik family was originally from kosovo but fled the region to the habsburg monarchy during the great serb migration of the family decided to return from exile to the principality of serbia the first modern serbian polity independent of ottoman rule in the mid th century putnik father dimitrije was teacher in kragujevac and radomir completed his basic schooling there he attended the artillery school the precursor to what would eventually become the military academy in belgrade where he graduated in placing eighth in his class in he married ljubica bojović the sister of who later became minister of military affairs and daughter of colonel todor bojević and jelena tadić with whom he had seven children three daughters and four sons contemporaries describe putnik as an ascetic introverted man and heavy smoker however he also had decided views on professional issues he proved himself on the battlefield during serbia wars against the ottomans fought between and it was military force under his command that took gnjilane and gračanica from the ottomans in kosovo during the closing stages of the second serbo ottoman war the serbian troops under major putnik were obliged to pull back to merdare in order to meet stipulation in the general armistice between russian and the ottomans putnik was noted for being self righteous and demanding officer prone to strongly defending his point of view putnik became professor in the military academy holding that position from to in he was appointed as the deputy chief of the general staff however he soon came into conflict with king milan partly for not allowing protégé of the king to pass an examination political intrigue and latent conflict with king milan obrenović and his successor king alexander would hinder his advancement throughout this part of his career in he was forced to retire by the king under suspicion of sympathy for the radical party of nikola pašić rehabilitation under peter putnik was rehabilitated following the coup etat against alexander obrenović in under the new king of serbia peter karadjordjević he was promoted to the rank of general and appointed as the chief of the general staff he then proceeded to completely reorganize the serbian army by retiring old and promoting new officers and updating outdated war plans putnik was serbian minister of war three times putnik appointed general živojin mišić as his deputy despite occasional personality clashes the two men had deep respect for each other putnik was the first officer to be appointed to the highest rank of field marshal in he led the serbian army into spectacular victories in the first balkan war against the ottomans battle of kumanovo october battle of monastir november and the second balkan war against bulgaria battle of bregalnica field marshal putnik expecting bulgarian attack had deployed his troops on the most important strategic points near the river bregalnica bregalnitza which was essential for quick victory after the sudden unannounced bulgarian attack world war radomir putnik in his office caught in budapest when austria hungary declared war upon his country field marshal putnik was allowed safe passage back to serbia in chivalrous and possibly self defeating gesture by the austro hungarian emperor franz josef after troublesome trip putnik returned to serbia and offered his resignation to king peter of serbia on the grounds of age and ill health it was rejected the king insisting that field marshal putnik take command over the army if only in strategic sense while younger generals such as stepa stepanović živojin mišić and petar bojović would take over operational duties putnik had to spend most of his time in well heated room however his impaired health did not prevent him from successfully organizing the campaign serbia defeated the austro hungarian army offensives in august and september battles of cer and kolubara driving it out of serbia by december the serbian front then remained relatively quiet until autumn when joint austro hungarian german and bulgarian forces led by german field marshal august von mackensen began large offensive against serbia with more than soldiers before the joint attack putnik warned the serbian government that bulgaria was concentrating her troops at the eastern serbian borders and that preventive attack on bulgaria was the only chance for serbia to avoid fighting on two fronts his demand was rejected due to the wishes of the allies who were still hoping to isolate bulgaria from joining the triple alliance despite heroic resistance the serbian troops were obliged to retreat towards kosovo on october putnik ordered general retreat onto kragujevac attempting to keep his exhausted army together as it sought to escape into friendly territory many of putnik soldiers were farmers who occasionally slipped away from the retiring army to resume their rural lives putnik rapidly declining forces continued their withdrawal towards albania during the first week of november process aided by the fact that the germans bulgarians and austro hungarians were reluctant to pursue serbian troops through the highlands of albania the germans felt that the war against serbia was won with most of the nation under the control of the central powers regarding the russian empire as the main threat in the east mackensen was eager to move his forces back to the russian front the bulgarians were satisfied with their territorial gains in macedonia and northwest serbia while the austro hungarians were equally content with the notion that the bulgarians were not moving to establish greater bulgaria the final confrontation occurred in kosovo the field of the blackbirds between and november the serbs were afflicted by new outbreak of typhus while food and ammunition was in extremely short supply facing inevitable defeat putnik made his last and most painful order on november full retreat southwards and westwards through montenegro and into albania his goal was to reach allied ships that would he hoped transport the core of the army to the safety of the ionian islands many of the fleeing soldiers and civilians died during the retreat to the coast lost to hunger disease attacks by enemy forces and albanian tribal bands the circumstances of the retreat were disastrous and all told some serbs out of mostly soldiers eventually reached the coast of the adriatic sea and embarked on allied transport ships that carried the army to various greek islands many to corfu before being deployed at the salonika front in april in worsening health putnik had to be carried in sedan chair during the retreat through snowy mountains of albania exhausted by the effort and episodes of bronchitis influenza and pneumonia putnik was met by allied forces in scutari skadar and transported first to brindisi and then to corfu along with the core of the army dismissal and death in the atmosphere of recrimination that followed between the serbian government and the high command the entire general staff was dismissed in january including field marshal putnik he felt embittered having learned of his dismissal from cashier who gave him his salary without chief of general staff supplement he traveled to nice where the french authorities welcomed him with honors and gave him villa putnik was overcome by lung emphysema and died on may without seeing his homeland again his remains were transferred to serbia in november and

secret police under ceauşescu and party financing by tycoon national liberal party foreign minister mihai răzvan ungureanu refused nomination the assignment of the multilingualism portfolio to the romanian commissioner by barroso was highly controversial barroso was severely criticized for creating new commissioner portfolio so that the accessing countries in could hold post the portfolio was criticized for being too light for such high rank official that there would be an overlap of with other commissioners and the good functioning of the commission would be endangered the portfolio was considered insubstantial for commissioner due to the limited jurisdiction of the eu in affecting language policy and the more administrative rather than political character of the post in addition it

easier to manage but multilingualism can also give any industry competitive advantage if it helps them to tap local markets and create new products which also cater for multilingualism according to orban multilingualism promotes labour mobility tolerance and sense of european citizenship and as an integral aspect of the legitimacy transparency and democracy of the european integration it contributes to successful eu communication policy within the lisbon strategy the target for foreign language learning is mother tongue plus two which means that english language skills on their own are not sufficient to address this orban aims to improve language teaching and to make the media and new communication technologies more language friendly he underlined that our efforts to support multilingualism are not limited to eu languages we are also encouraging training in chinese japanese arabic turkish and russian he added that the promotion of language learning and linguistic

      "virtual artifact va is an immaterial object that exists in the human mind or in digital environment for example the internet intranet virtual reality cyberspace etc background the term virtual artifact has been used in variety of ways in scientific and public discourse previously it has referred to objects of different nature images user interfaces models prototypes computer animation virtual books that exist in digital environments the concept behind the term is rapidly developing and expanding as new phenomena emerge in the virtual domain history of the phenomenon imaginary worlds characters items etc have been described in stories and tales since the dawn of humanity in the philosophic discourse utopias have existed where extensive systems and their components have been depicted in detail imaginary artifacts have been described and created in terms of language and visual presentation the development of the visual presentation techniques linear perspective cinematography enabled more sophisticated methods to describe these artifacts events and entities in painting photography and film moreover virtual artifacts were and still are commonly found in environments that require strong imaginary aspect in order to be experienced such as radio shows novels tabletop role playing games etc the development of computing enabled the creation of interactive virtual environments that were based on digital technologies and new methods of presentation in digital environments virtual artifacts became independent entities that could exist and interact outside the human mind even previously unknown complex forms and imaginary artifacts fractals could be created and represented in these environments in digital environments humans have expanded the existing environment to the virtual domain virtual artifacts can be seen as an essential cultural phenomenon in modern society virtual artifacts bear meanings and functions and since they are part of the world they affect real world events and people lives virtual artifacts have certain similarities to real life artifacts even though they do not have physical properties in the traditional sense however real life objects and environments can be simulated in digital environments like computer games modeling or virtual reality simulated virtual objects photorealistic va and environments have model in the real world however depending on the context an abstract virtual artifact isn necessarily dependent on the laws of physics or causality some virtual artifacts are purely abstract in their nature therefore they can model real life objects or phenomena for example computer programs or digital user interfaces while often containing representative components of real life objects can exist in physical terms these virtual artifacts do not have to be comprehensible to humans at all they can be created and understood solely by artificial intelligence virtual artifacts can have physical properties for example color length depending on the environment they exist in these physical properties can be presented and perceived using certain medium such as computer screen on the other hand virtual artifacts can also contain properties that aren perceptible due to their immaterial nature they can be flexibly accessed reproduced and archived even simultaneously by multiple users purposes and uses in the field of archeology real world artifacts are modeled reproduced in digital environment where they can be modified reconstructed and archived also whole historical sites and buildings theban mapping project are reconstructed in virtual environment virtual artifacts are crucial part of digital imaginary game worlds artwork paintings interactive installations music videos that is presented archived in virtual environment can be considered as virtual artifact virtual artifacts parts of simulated experiments models are used in many areas of scientific research medical science chemistry astronomy designers such as fashion designers industrial designers architects use virtual artifacts prototypes testing environments in their work process virtual art artists using virtual reality augmented reality and mixed reality as medium produce virtual artworks virtual consumerism virtual artifacts can have virtual and or real exchange value and thus can be considered as products person or other juristically defined actor can claim ownership and invest money in virtual artifacts virtual artifacts can also be valuable in an economical sense outside the environment virtual world such as ones found in massively multiplayer online games they are created in for example game items and characters are valued in terms of real currencies within many virtual worlds there exists virtual economy that often mimics real life commercial features and models such as trading with in game virtual artifacts virtual currencies supply and demand etc there is viable real life business model based on the exchange of virtual artifacts within virtual environment one example is the social networking game habbo hotel in habbo world users buy virtual products such as furniture for their virtual hotel room with real money many online games require paid subscription for providing access to the game world creating revenue to the creator of the world moreover virtual game environments have also created commercial models around them in fact the market for virtual artifacts such as game items or virtual property is booming in china for example people are hired to play online games to

model like himself command centurion command centurion are centurions with gold armor these are the lower commanders for individual military units though they can be responsible for entire basestars and garrisons the most well known cylon of this model is commander vulpa so identified in the cylon death machine robert thurston novelization of the gun on ice planet zero their voices are slightly lower pitched than regular centurions in the novelization of the original series it is stated that there is an elite class of command centurions referred to as first centurions roughly equivalent to feudal counts which act as executive officers to the imperious leader and are not subordinate to the il series and like the il series they were also said to have multiple brains in the tv series these are actually seen on screen though very rarely and are distinguished from other command centurions by black bands on their gold armor vulpa was originally of this class but had been demoted and stationed on ice planet arcta centurion military androids with silver armor basic centurions make up the ground forces and pilots of the alliance military although earth roman centurions commanded unit of eighty men cylon centurions form the rank and file of the cylon forces centurions are armed with powerful energy weapon often referred to as blaster rifle they also have bayonets and swords for close combat and the execution of prisoners some centurions in the series have been given names flight leader serpentine from saga of star world and cyrus from the return of starbuck galactica in the episode the lost warrior there is cylon centurion that remained active after its ship crashed on the planet equellus and was named red eye by the humans who found it in the night the cylons landed galactica the centurion accompanying the android andromus was introduced as centuri to humans in costume but this might have been an attempt to disguise the centurions true nature the cylon centurions the type most often depicted in the original battlestar galactica were strikingly similar to the imperial stormtroopers of star wars in fact both were designed by the same concept artist ralph mcquarrie the similarities were so strong that it was one of the factors that prompted th century fox lawsuit for copyright infringement against universal studios owners of the battlestar galactica copyright however the lawsuit was ultimately unsuccessful both the gold command centurions and the silver centurions had their voices vocalized with the use of an ems vocoder civilian there is also unique cylon with glittering robes with metallic humanoid face they are seen in the imperious leader delegation to gamoray in the living legend this is evidently some kind of civilian cylon as gamoray is said to have very large community of civilian cylons though how civilian cylon society differs from its military is never explored this is the only known kind of civilian cylons however as they must have had some kind of admission to the reception of the imperious leader it can be assumed that they are not typical civilian cylons they were perhaps members of some kind of aristocracy humanoid the cylon humanoid is rather new model probably first built long after the destruction of the twelve colonies of the humans although entirely mechanical beneath an artificial skin the humanoid model is in fact an android featuring superficial human appearance as well as condescending attitude toward the non humanoid centurions two cylon humanoids are featured in the episode the night the cylons landed of galactica one of which is named andromus spacecraft the cylons are described as devoted race that spends no time in any idle pursuits and they employ several models but only of necessary spacecraft such as these cylon fighters cylon raider heavy fighter with crew of three two pilots and commander they are armed with dual firing laser cannons raider an advanced variation of the raider crewed by three centurions and two cylon androids seen in the galactica episode the night the cylons landed part the reimagined series analogue of this is the cylon heavy raider cylon capital ships basestar large warship with two mounted pulsars and many laser turrets carrying raiders but with no visible engines civilian or dual use cylon ships cylon freighter cargo ship referenced in the battlestar galactica soundtrack and ship that was responsible for the electronic jamming at the battle of cimtar in saga of star world cylon tanker ship for transporting the fuel tylium the cylons used at least one if not two to fuel their fighters at the battle of cimtar in saga of star world apollo and zac found the one conclusively so identified to have been emptied two others were encountered at the battle of gamoray in the living legend civilization in the galactica movie and series and the spin off the cylons were created by an extinct reptilian race that were also called cylons as related by apollo in the premiere episode in the episode war of the gods count baltar mentions that the reptilian cylons were ultimately overcome by their own technology particularly after the imperious leader was created despite having had slight error in its programming and recognizes iblis voice as that of the cylon leader and iblis counters that if that were true it must have been transcribed over thousand yahren years ago at the beginning of the series the cylons are singularly devoted to the destruction of humanity the war started when the cylon empire sought to expand into the territory of the hasaris and the human colonies intervened on behalf of the conquered hasaris due to those events the cylon empire now viewed the entire human race as target cylons are led by the imperious leader an il series cylon elevated to supreme leadership position over all cylons all cylons from the il series down typically repeat the phrase by your command when responding to any order the cylon empire is also responsible for tributary powers under the aegis of the cylon alliance the ovions an insectoid race enslaved by the cylons and transported to the planet carillon for mining purposes are the only known member of the cylon alliance shown onscreen aside from the ovions and the defeated hasaris the only other known race conquered by the cylons are the delphians which are mentioned to have been exterminated in the living legend cylon society appears to be almost exclusively military until the discovery of gamoray which the colonial fleet had targeted for its rich fuel reserves no civilian cylon outpost had ever been seen by anyone official spin offs related works novels in the novelization of the series pilot the cylons are described as militaristic reptilian race which has been conquering its way across the galaxy the novelization is written by glen larson the series creator who originally intended the cylons to be an alien species and in fact dialog which was later edited out of saga of star world illustrated this point however network censors were concerned about violence so the cylons became robots by this time two novels had been written describing the cylons as multibrained aliens so the cylon drone was invented to justify all the robots dying on screen as living organic beings the original cylon troops could be promoted through the surgical implantation of second brain when cylon was elevated to imperious leader he received third brain the novelization of the original series states that an elite class of command centurions act as executive officers to the imperious leader and are not subordinate to the il series in the tv series they are distinguished from other command centurions by black bands on their gold armor and are very rarely seen vulpa was originally of this class but had been demoted and stationed on ice planet arcta in the later novelization of the original series it is stated that there is class lower than the typical centurion that of the cylon drone although appearing identical to centurions drones are robots not capable of sophisticated independent thought beyond following simple instructions to perform menial tasks multibrain status and built in lie detectors the berkley book series also explored two other aspects of cylon design the first is the development of multiple brain status this allows cylons additional thinking and deductive abilities the second is an unexplained talent for knowing when human is lying which was suggested in the episode the lost warrior presented in the gun on ice planet zero book the second of the two novels written before the network insisted the cylons become robots their multibrain status is the surgical inclusion of an auxiliary brain allowing for higher level thinking abilities the command centurion and garrison commander on planet tairac vulpa demonstrated this ability cylon centurions the chrome soldiers have single brain status command centurions have three brain status imperious leaders enjoy three or four brain status il series cylons such as lucifer and specter have second brain status comic books according to the maximum press comic of battlestar galactica just prior to the start of the thousand yahren war the cylons imperious leader made deal with the mysterious and demonic count iblis meaning satan in the arabic language to betray his entire race in exchange for power that would allow him to become like count iblis count iblis however having lied about the process of empowerment instead changed the imperious leader into cybernetic entity more machine than organic being enraged the imperious leader swore revenge and became more and more driven by conquest and warfare in the maximum press comic the cylons were originally led by ruthless conquest and expansionism driven emperor named sobekkta one of the original living cylons who were race of intelligent humanoid reptiles in battlestar galactica berserker apollo during planetary search unfortunately comes across lone mark iii prototype cylon which proves to be more creative and adaptive like humans in his strategy giving it more capability to defeat humans the existing cylons deemed this advanced cylon prototype more threat to them however due to his unquenchable megalomania to rule and so they marooned him far from the cylon empire until needed if ever video games the cylons also appear in the official computer game adaptation which is prequel to both the original and re imagined series toys larami came out with bubble toy in called the battlestar galactica cylon bubble machine as well as line of other inexpensive toys in popular culture in the source code of mozilla and its netscape predecessor the indeterminate progress bar that slides back and forth rather than rolling or filling up from left to right is referred to as the cylon two cylon references can be witnessed in the futurama series in bendin in the wind cylon is part

      "cylons are fictional artificially intelligent species envisioned in the battlestar galactica science fiction series and related franchises originally created to serve human needs like other machines series of events involving the transfer of human consciousness into cylon neural network led cylons to evolve into sentient self aware beings the original cylons were purely mechanical the cylon was reimagined in the second battlestar galactica television series and its prequel caprica the first configurations centurions were robots others were cyborgs whose different configurations incorporated biological elements including some that were nearly from humans background one of the series core themes is all of this has happened before and will happen again cylon centurions were invented twice once thousands of years before the events of battlestar galactica and later they fought war against the thirteenth tribe on earth the second centurion creation is detailed in the prequel series caprica there they were created by zoe graystone and her father daniel graystone owner of graystone industries caprica centurions the caprica cylon is combination of programming done by zoe and daniel mcp enhanced meta cognitive processor graystone industries robot common activity on caprica was to participate in virtual world world that allowed players to live an alternate existence the original cylon was developed as place to house zoe avatar virtual existence after she is killed in bombing on maglev train in caprica episode her father sees her avatar in world and forces her best friend lacy to take him to her there where she explains that she is much more than simple digital simulation she has zoe memories from neural scan zoe developed to extend world character into virtual instance of the person the digital zoe says to her father don feel like copy and she becomes the basis of the first cylons cylons were originally accepted into caprican culture as robotic workers after group of them under direct remote control by graystone himself with the help of his wife amanda successfully thwarted an attack on the public at atlas stadium by the soldiers of the one sto the cylons then spread throughout the colonies as worker class but because they had basic self awareness they became increasingly resentful of their servitude battlestar galactica in battlestar galactica the cylons were created thousands of years before the series began they destroyed the thirteenth tribe living on the original earth years before bsgr cylon society consists of three classes biological ruling class androids pejoratively skinjobs labor warrior class centurions and transport air warrior class basestars and raiders basestars and raiders are partly biological cyborgs and as such are vulnerable to biological threats such as disease raiders and centurions while intelligent were inhibited from exercising free will although the hybrids that controlled basestars did exercise some autonomy and were respected by the skinjobs the skinjobs lead cylon society some are sleeper agents programmed with false memories to think they are human cylons can convincingly interact with humans and are capable of intimate relationships they have limited superhuman abilities such as increased stamina and strength and the ability to connect with computer systems cylons are more sensitive than humans to some forms of radiation and more resistant than humans to others they can upload their memories to other copies of their model through central station another cylon of the same model can then access these memories the humanoid cylons have the ability to distinguish between copies by sight unlike centurions and humans toasters centurions are often called toasters by humans partly reference to their metallic construction but also to demean them toaster was also used to derogate skinjob another derogatory term and an homage to the film blade runner in which bsgr star edward james olmos has supporting role centurions were also termed chromejobs or bulletheads the chronological origin of the word toaster can be found in the prequel caprica episode which was created after bsg had ended after car crash made the first ever test cylon inoperable it was considered toast after which tomas vergis joked or toaster the term skinjob is originally used in caprica episode where new body is being discussed for an avatar and ai of zoe the parents emphasize it will be with skin as opposed to the cylon metal prototypes which she then calls skinjob reproduction cylons were initially unable to produce children with each other they turned their attention to mating with humans their crossbreeding experiments in facilities called farms are unsuccessful they theorize that love is necessary for them to procreate because god is love in their theology this leads to successful experiment in which an eight and human karl agathon fall in love and produce daughter named hera skinjobs can download their consciousness into another body when the body they are using dies giving them virtual immortality these downloads have limited range requiring the cylons to build resurrection ship to capture them if not within range of resurrection ship downloading is unavailable and cylon death is permanent the downloading process is shared by the semi organic raider spacecraft which allows raiders who have been killed several times to become more formidable fighters scar the centurions do not download resurrection ships function as boosters for the central resurrection hub without the hub resurrection is not possible this technology was first shown in caprica in an attempt to resurrect deceased relatives in so called resurrection program first called that way in episode in virtual reality where one could meet and interact with those one was mourning for projection cylons have an ability referred to as projection form of realistic daydreaming that allows them to change the appearance of their surroundings in their own mind making the corridors of ship look like forest etc they have the ability to touch smell etc the fantasy environment they can share projections and create virtual individuals as part of the fantasy this ability allows them to express their subconscious desires boxing if cylon is deemed dangerous by the other models he or she may be boxed deactivated with consciousness and memories placed in storage this may involve particular copy or an entire line boxed consciousnesses are stored in the resurrection hub and can be unboxed the term was also used in the prequel caprica episode which discusses boxing defunct test cylon as literally placing it in crate for deep storage as caprica is the prequel this is chronologically the first time of its use from which the cylons derived their own definition history thirteenth tribe between years before the second cylon war it is implied that the humans and cylons of kobol fought each other but the nature of the conflict remains unrevealed the thirteenth tribe were cylons who fled kobol and settled on planet they dubbed earth eventually they developed the ability to reproduce sexually resurrection technology fell into disuse and was lost the final five redeveloped resurrection following warnings by mysterious angels that kobol like disaster was coming when life on cylon earth was destroyed in nuclear war between the thirteenth tribe and their mechanical cylon creations stemming from the latter maltreatment at the hands of the tribe the final five downloaded into an orbiting vessel the final five wanted to warn the other twelve colonies to treat their cylon workers well to prevent another catastrophe however without faster than light ftl travel they required approximately years to make the journey relative to human time while only few years passed inside the ship due to special relativity when they arrived the twelve colonies cylon centurions had revolted and the first cylon war was raging it lasted roughly twelve and half years the final five learned that these centurions were trying to develop organic bodies through experiments on humans resulting in the first hybrid to end the war the final five helped the centurions develop skinjob model numbers one to eight model number seven creation was sabotaged by one and resurrection technology the war ended with an armistice and an attempt by the colonies to establish diplomatic relations between the parties instead the cylons disappeared for forty years the first of the colonial skinjobs one john cavil refused to let the final five concern for humanity blind them he boxed the final five he then periodically sent them to the colonies to see how terrible humanity was second cylon war after forty years the colonial admiralty sent battlestar valkyrie on covert mission close to the armistice line to gather intelligence on cylon activity stealth ship from the valkyrie crossed the armistice line but was intercepted by the cylons three years later the cylons initiated surprise attack on the colonies the attack was successful because cylon agent later known as caprica six infiltrated caprica colonial defense network with the unwitting complicity of renowned scientist gaius baltar and created backdoor programs to shut down the network and its defenses the attacks wiped out billions of humans nearly the entire colonial population two battlestars galactica and pegasus survived fleet of civilian ships was scattered throughout the neighboring space together they fled into deep space the cylons pursued them while initiating the next phase of their evolution procreation female human survivors were detained and used in experiments to create cylon human hybrids the experiments were unsuccessful leading the cylons to conclude that the missing component was love they tested this by using an eight posing as lt sharon boomer valerii from galactica to seduce marooned galactica officer lt karl helo agathon on caprica they fell in love the eight abandoned the cylons helping helo to escape the couple later produced the first viable human cylon birth this eight joined the fleet with helo she later married helo joined the colonial military and received the call sign athena ten months after the initial attacks eight sharon valerii call sign boomer attempted to assassinate commander adama under the influence of unexplained programing unknown to her she was unaware that she was cylon before the attack though she had been uneasy because of unexplained blackouts during various attempts to sabotage galactica vengeful crew mate cally henderson killed her she downloaded into new body and settled on cylon occupied caprica in her former apartment unable to relinquish her human identity she led campaign for better treatment of the humans she and other like minded cylons influenced the cylon civilization which withdrew from the colonial home worlds and pursued benevolent treatment of the humans and then reconciliation during this time the half human half cylon hybrid hera agathon was born on galactica fearing that the cylons might capture the child president laura roslin faked hera death and secretly had her adopted by human woman new caprica the humans settled on barren planet they dubbed new caprica the refuge lasted year before the cylons found them the cylons occupied the new human settlement at first peacefully but later forcefully and more viciously as the human resistance increased in the end they used punitive methods to keep the humans in line including summary executions and infiltration by seemingly sympathetic cylons one such infiltrator was an eight model who manipulated felix gaeta into giving her list of people the resistance desired to free from cylon detention whom she then had executed escape four months later the colonials escaped with the help of resistance movement and the efforts of both the galactica and pegasus the escape required athena help she entered the cylon facility and took the keys to the various colonial landing craft prior to this three found out from human oracle that hera was alive and on the planet she rescued hera after her adoptive mother was killed during the escape the pegasus sacrificed itself to save the crippled galactica but the crew survived joining galactica the cylons then adopted the colonials mission to find the home of the thirteenth tribe planet they called earth intending to settle there they resumed pursuit of the fleet but upon reaching the lion head nebula dispatched basestar to investigate the basestar took on board canister left by the thirteenth tribe the canister contained an airborne virus that proved deadly to the cylons the virus persisted through the download process so the basestar that had been dispatched for the investigation was abandoned to avoid contamination the colonial fleet discovered the basestar and captured the ailing cylons the colonial fleet attempt to use the virus to wipe out the cylons was defeated when helo repulsed by the strategy had the captive cylons killed while out of range of resurrection ship meanwhile boomer turned increasingly anti human she was charged with hera care but hera rejected her during truce negotiation boomer told athena that her daughter was alive but sick on the baseship she invited athena to come to the baseship and rejoin her people because the occupation showed that humans and cylons were incompatible and that humans would never truly accept her later desperate for her child athena convinced helo to kill her so she could resurrect on the baseship once there she retrieved hera with the help of caprica six who killed hate filled boomer to prevent her from killing the child she had tried to prevent athena from taking hera to the humans and declared that cylons were never meant to have children caprica six returned with athena and was detained by adama in athena old cell cylon struggles as the pursuit continued internal relations among the cylons began to break down three violated her programming by actively seeking information about the final five seeing vision of them on the algae planet where the colonials stopped to get food from that she was able to identify them she and her twins were then boxed within the fleet musical activation signal version of all along the watchtower was received by the final five awakening their memories and bringing them together two were galactica crew members saul tigh and galen tyrol while samuel anders was an athlete and tory foster political operative they kept their discovery secret tigh and anders remained loyal to the humans willing to fight and possibly die for them tyrol and foster were ambivalent with tyrol having pro human leanings foster became increasingly anti human murdering tyrol wife without remorse after their realization the fleet came under attack but during the battle cylon raider identified anders and he and his fellow raiders broke off the attack refusing to fight this set off debate in the cylon government regarding the raiders ones fours and fives voted to lobotomize the raiders to make them acquiescent twos sixes and eights led principally by six named natalie became convinced that the raiders had sensed the presence of the final five boomer assenting vote broke the tie natalie objected and removed inhibitor circuitry from the centurions granting them free will and independent thought the centurions then killed the models who were lobotomizing the raiders in response cavil lured natalie and her forces into trap beyond resurrection range and slaughtered them only natalie crippled basestar survived with her raiders destroyed except for some heavy raiders and the surviving twos sixes and eights minus boomer natalie allowed two leoben conoy to locate kara thrace and ally with the humans deal was struck the humans would help the rebels unbox the threes and the rebels would lead the humans to the resurrection hub and help them destroy it so cavil would lose resurrection forever the humans transferred half of their vipers to the rebel basestar fearing for hera athena murdered natalie causing the hybrid to jump the rebel basestar with roslin on board away before everyone was ready the hybrid took the basestar to the hub where the allies had the human vipers towed into battle by cylon heavy raiders so they could catch the cylons by surprise the plan worked and the hub ftl drive was taken out stranding it while the rebel basestar engaged two other basestars helo and an eight boarded the hub to unbox anna and found her already unboxed by cavil and boomer the three escaped and the vipers nuked the hub destroying it and cylon resurrection capability after standoff the identities of the four cylons in the human fleet were revealed and together they found the devastated earth nuclear wasteland there tigh anders foster and tyrol got flashes of their life on earth and tigh learned the identity of the fifth member his dead wife ellen the humans and rebel cylons minus anna abandoned earth in search of new home together the humans and cylons ended up striking deal in return for joining the fleet as full members the rebels would upgrade the fleet ftl drives with cylon technology increasing their jump distance by at least three times this led to political coup and failed mutiny but left anders seriously injured although with his true memories returned after telling the others as much as he could anders slipped into coma from which he partially emerged while acting as galactica hybrid cavil revealed that he had resurrected ellen tigh as his prisoner ever since her download after she was killed on new caprica her resurrection restored her true memories although her only company was cavil and boomer whom he let in on the secret after cavil planned to dissect her brain to try to regain resurrection technology boomer helped ellen escape to the fleet as part of plan to kidnap hera so the cylons could study her galactica and some of the rebel cylons assaulted the cylon space station that was the cylon homeworld to rescue hera while the rebel basestar protected the fleet during the battle boomer who had begun to feel remorse for kidnapping hera killed the four that was starting to dissect the child and carried her back to her parents athena then killed boomer the rescue team returned to galactica where cavil led centurion assault but was defeated he took hera hostage but was convinced to create permanent peace with the humans in exchange for the final five giving him resurrection technology tyrol learns that foster murdered cally and breaks the download causing the cylons to attack again cavil kills himself an unmanned raptor is struck by an asteroid causing the dead pilot racetrack to fire eight nuclear missiles into the colony knocking it out of orbit and into black hole destroying it and every remaining one four and five galactica jumps away and arrives at habitable planet the humans and rebel cylons settle there while the rebel centurions are given their freedom and the rebel basestar to find their own destiny anders flies the human fleet and all its technology into the sun years later it is revealed that the planet they settled on is our earth while hera was mitochondrial eve which means all modern humans are partly descended from the humanoid cylons centurions the cylon centurion is mechanical infantry model made less intelligent than human models bsgr centurions retain the silver appearance robotic body helmet like head and oscillating red bar eye of their forbearers but are larger taller stronger more agile and have more streamlined appearance they also have retractable guns built into their lower arms bladed fingertips and heavy armour the centurions were monotheists who believed in single loving god initial models the first colonial centurion is seen and is identified as cybernetic lifeform node built on contract for the caprican defense ministry the cylons are to replace human warriors on the battlefield caprica pilot the prototype cylon contains copy of the consciousness of daniel graystone daughter zoe graystone daniel graystone conceives of the cylons as slave race and demonstrates this by instructing the prototype to rip her own arm off after catching it interacting with the family dog he realises that the prototype contains zoe consciousness and attempts without success to force her to admit her identity she is able to defeat the tests he attempts and convinces him that she is just robot upon learning that graystone is about to erase her memory she escapes the battlestar galactica miniseries displays an original model centurion on display in galactica museum hangar the original centurion is also depicted in diagram reviewed by the armistice officer in the opening scene in battlestar galactica razor centurions are almost identical to those from the original series except they are rendered using cgi and have exposed joints the centurion in the museum hangar is retconned as cgi version with exposed joints initial model centurions are among those seen defending the cylon colony from an assault by colonial and rebel cylon forces part of daybreak the body had synthetic skin although this model was still primitive and was mechanical rather than biological later model centurions do not download into new bodies when they are destroyed according to screenwriter ronald moore the hybrids have something to do with the programming of the centurions when the virus infected the hybrid on the infected basestar the centurions shut down torn however centurions can function independently when no basestars or skinjobs are nearby centurion immediately fires upon an eight when she unplugs hybrid faith it is unclear whether this was in willful defiance of the hybrid or as result of the removal of their higher function inhibitor modules six of one after the inhibitor modules that restrict higher functions granting them independent thought were removed although still largely servile the centurions were shown to exhibit human like behaviour such as politeness and consideration responding to please these centurions are taller than their predecessors and are sleeker they possess less of humanoid structure averaging head taller than humans they retain the bipedal structure of the first model as well as rough hands and feet the feet of the new centurions are simple two toed form that produces distinctive sound when they walk as the toes move and touch the ground they retain the distinctive oscillating red eye as well as rudimentary mouth even though they cannot speak the hands are much thinner and visibly segmented and more claw like they can cut flesh and mortally wound human making them effective close combat weapons these claws can be modified at will to more finger like digit or less of razor sharp weapon perhaps the most distinctive feature of this model is the twin cannons built into each hand mounted on the side that can be deployed by retracting the hands it was originally established that the centurions could not move while firing their cannons however in later seasons they were seen to walk and even run while firing the centurions carry heavy weapons such as anti aircraft rockets that are strapped to their backs for missions where their cannons are not enough most centurions can be destroyed or at least damaged by small arms fire however most require substantial artillery or special rounds to be destroyed centurions party that boarded galactica were especially strong and required explosive rounds to be destroyed as regular rounds proved completely ineffective these centurions greatly outmatched the previous model they were better armoured stronger and carried internal weapons as opposed to their predecessors who needed to carry weapons such as rifles and pistols like their human creators raiders the later form of cylon raiders are biomechanical entities integrated into small fighter spacecraft they resurrect when they die raiders are subservient and were compared to trained animals by the humanoid cylons raider nicknamed scar developed personality scar scar was the cylons top gun driven by bitter hatred of humans he was killed and reborn many times raiders do not use vocal communication appearing to communicate through unspecified electronic signals modern raiders unlike their predecessors in the first cylon war are alive with complex system of veins organs and biological fluids contained within their main body the raiders are programmed but began with some measure of autonomy and personality when one raider saw final five in the human fleet during an attack it retreated leading the remaining raiders back to the basestar the raiders then refused to fight the humans for fear of harming their cylon kin this led to the lobotomy vote well trained colonial pilots even nuggets can beat raider in most situations the raiders primary advantage seemed to be in their massive numbers while galactica carries around vipers cylon basestars support raiders the raiders are maneuverable once described by kara as squirmy son of bitch and most human pilots were unable to keep them in sight for more than few seconds weapons the raiders primary weapons are two kinetic energy guns mounted on the underside of their wings close to the main body they may carry conventional missiles and tactical nuclear weapons raiders by revealing their red eye can transmit deadly computer viruses or signals to enemy ships which strike with brutal efficiency and can shut down colonial vessels turning off their power and making them easy prey if all else fails raiders sometimes attempt suicide attacks single raider can destroy sizeable transport the raiders from the first cylon war were larger spacecraft driven by centurion pilots and not alive these are used by the remaining first war centurions guarding the original hybrid and the cylon colony and later became obsolete heavy raiders the later cylon raiders are different from cylon heavy raiders like the raiders of the first cylon war the heavy raiders are transports and attack bombers and are primarily piloted by sixes and eights significant seven although they made only single appearance in the original continuity the episode the night the cylons landed from galactica humanoid cylons are the focus of the reimagining they are usually known as the cylons or derogatorily as skinjobs or toasters skinjobs are from humans due to their creation through synthetic biology employing real bones flesh and blood rather than metal but still possess digital molecular structure some are programmed to believe that they are organic until otherwise informed the cylons can communicate nonverbally but do not have hive mind even among single model and are most often shown talking to one another the thirteen distinct humanoid models are divided into the final five that originated on earth and significant seven the latter term is only used by the battlestar galactica producers the final five are unique and are the last survivors of the thirteenth tribe they developed the seven originally eight in conjunction with the centurions of the twelve colonies each copy shares biology and general personality throughout their model but they develop into distinct individuals the final five showed the centurions how to make skinjobs and attempted to give them human characteristics love mercy thinking that these characteristics would prevent war prior to the final five arriving to stop the first cylon war on caprica the centurions had already made their first humanoid called the hybrid for the purpose of controlling the baseship once the final five arrived on caprica they transferred their technology to the centurions and gave them eight fully humanoid models created by them cylon society is made up of the seven whose types are numbered one two three four five six and eight the extinct seven model the daniel series was destroyed by one decades prior to the colonies destruction it all happened before and it will happen again as revealed towards the end of season there is year gap between the exodus of the first humanoid cylons the final five from the destruction of life on earth due to robot centurion war there and their arrival at caprica in the middle of the caprican robot centurion war originally the final five had left earth both to seek new home and to warn the other twelve colonies about the dangers of mistreating centurions so that they might avoid the fate of earth however at the time ftl faster than light starship jumping technology was unknown so they made the journey using slower than light technology resurrecting themselves when their bodies wore out over the span of years it should be noted that when the earth was nuked years prior the final five cylons had already planned for this event and were resurrected onto their baseship in orbit when their bodies were destroyed in global nuclear attack that wiped out all life on earth this resurrection was the event which triggered the final five cylons to begin their year journey to caprica only to find out upon arrival that humans and centurion robots had begun fighting towards extinction just as they had years prior on earth the final five arrived at caprica to discover that the caprican centurions had already begun experimenting with creating humanoid cylons by creating the first hybrid to control their baseship as part of the agreement to end the war with humans the final five cylons gave the caprican centurions eight humanoid cylon models and resurrection ship during the year gap between the end of the first cylon war and the second cylon war on caprica cavil model number one of the eight humanoid cylons that the final five had designed and created rebelled against the final five and took command of the centurions and of the other humanoid cylons in order to get rid of the final five who blocked him from continuing the cylon war he tricked the final five into to living on caprica with their memories erased and false memories implanted he was deluded into believing that he could show the final five that they were wrong about humans by letting them suffer with the humans as their civilization was destroyed as result of him restarting the cylon war and then restoring their memories while resurrecting them on the cylon baseship cavil thought this lesson would help the final five realize that humans were flawed creatures and thus persuade them to take his side ellen the original creator of the eight humanoid models programmed them with belief in single god that is all loving she did this because she wanted the cylons to know love and to be peaceful and to avoid war in the future however cavil rejected his programming of believing in an all loving god other cylons particularly the anna model justified attacking the humans perhaps as form of religious fundamentalism with the goal of remaking the world as cylon one god utopia in addition cavil regarded the creation of humanoid cylons as mistake and believed that cylons should return to purely mechanical form so that they could experience the world in ways not limited by human senses for example he said that when star explodes into supernova he wants to see the rays and gamma rays with his eyes and not be limited by biological human eyes cavil was fearful of the mechanical centurions rejecting the secret removal of circuitry to prevent the centurions from having free will in season when centurions on one of the cylon baseships received this modification and thus developed free will they revolted against cavil because they rejected his policy of removing the biological brains of the raider ships and returning them to purely mechanical form so that they would follow orders without emotion interfering this small rebellion left the sixes and eights in charge of one of the baseships in the cylon fleet the rebel baseship later forms an alliance with the human fleet after being attacked by cavil cylon fleet and left to drift in space without ftl propulsion roles the skinjobs are responsible for command decisions while the command structure has not been fully explored some hints at organization are known at the end of the mini series group of skinjobs debate what to do and one speaks authoritatively to which another responds by your command reference to the original series they can freely impose blocks on the behavior and cognitive programming of centurions raiders and hybrids multiple skinjobs with blocked memories are spread among the surviving humans including members of galactica crew cylon council made up of multiple copies of several models appears to cast votes collectively by model indicating that model plays an important role in the structure of cylon society precipice some models are implied to have higher or lower ranks than others during the occupation of new caprica select group of individuals who mostly had been within the colonies such as boomer and caprica six seemed to have seniority within their model one of each model was seen deliberating and discussing their course of action with each of the senior copies representing the opinion of their model although little is known about cylon psychology it is clear that they share many human emotional vulnerabilities this is evidenced by gina catatonic state as result of the severe trauma of her abuse at the hands of the pegasus crew this abuse was presented in the form of multiple sexual assaults battery starvation and outright torture six caprica six also revealed that cylons exist by projecting an environment of their choice on the real physical world number one john cavil ones subvert consensus by undertaking many actions without the knowledge or consent of their siblings such as turning against the sevens and the final five and then reprogramming their siblings to hide this the main antagonist of the series john cavil initially poses as priest lay down your burdens his true identity is revealed when second copy boards galactica and reveals his cylon nature cavil role in society is contradictory he occasionally serves as devil advocate pointing out the absurdity of his fellow cylons and their religious zealotry he was revealed to be one six of one cavil has sadistic machiavellian streak that none of the other cylon models share he tortured saul tigh by gouging out one of his eyes and showing it to him he took pleasure in blackmailing ellen tigh into providing sexual favours in exchange for releasing saul from captivity on new caprica cavil is an atheist alone among the seven models and often mockingly uses air quotes when saying the word god his opinions of humans are contradictory he is one of the most violently anti human cylon models advocating policy of culling humanity down to controllable number he claimed to have been against the destruction of the twelve colonies and advocates unique cylon society not one that emulates its creators after arranging tigh release cavil further manipulated the situation by again blackmailing ellen to betray the human resistance on new caprica and threatening to kill saul if she did not comply cavil is aloof compared to the other models though boomer implies that cavil has begun teaching her his views that cylons should not emulate humanity cavil knows aspects of cylon lore that the others models do not his knowledge of the final five led him to box the anna and the other threes to ensure that whatever she had learned about the final five stayed hidden he was made in ellen father image ellen also named him john he hates this name and shows deep resentment towards ellen at being limited by having to live in humanoid body one was the first model and helped the final five create the other seven therefore ones knew about the final five while the others knew only that they existed for an unstated reason cavil rejected the human trait of mercy and turned against the final five when the final five were resurrected cavil implants new memories for their life in the twelve colonies he also alters the original programming of the seven other models so that searching for talking about and even thinking about the final five was strictly forbidden ones are played by dean stockwell number two leoben conoy leoben first appears as smuggler at the munitions depot at ragnar anchorage where he was exposed as cylon mini series twos are religious zealots carrying pathological and sometimes sexual obsession with starbuck his cylon identity was revealed six of one twos are skilled at deceit conoy manipulates starbuck into thinking that young girl he had kidnapped on new caprica is her biological daughter twos display cunning minds and the ability to find and exploit others weaknesses unlike other cylons twos appear to be prescient and on several occasions prophesy future events twos are played by callum keith rennie number three anna biers anna biers was reporter for the fleet news service roslin and adama grant biers access to all areas of galactica to investigate her suspicions of military cover up surrounding civilian deaths aboard the gideon their belief is that biers will discover that military personnel deal with the same pressures and fears as the rest of the fleet and that the events were tragic mistake the biers model used the documentary as means to relay information that sharon was alive to cylons on caprica final cut anna was revealed to be three in the episode downloaded threes are among the more aggressive models and share fatalistic understanding of the cylon religion believing that everything that happens is the will of god their religious devotion masks deep questioning by threes about why god allows bad things to happen theodicy threes possess an alpha female aggressiveness advancing themselves as de facto leaders in any situation they are often rivals of ones and sixes the rivalry with the sixes partly stems from when caprica six killed three to save samuel anders from torture and death anna and caprica six later reconcile and both of them are involved in relationship with baltar baltar seduces anna by exploring her crisis of faith which leads to her secretly committing suicide major cylon taboo to experience resurrection she feels these near death experiences will answer questions regarding her faith notably the identity of the final five anna eventually sees the faces of the final five rapture unfortunately as she does so the other cylons vote to box all threes cavil tells her that what she had seen regarding the final five was unacceptable and that her memories would be kept in cold storage anna but not the other threes is later unboxed the hub threes are among the more anti human cylons anna tells baltar that she believes that humanity must die to prevent future generations of humans from seeking revenge exodus part ii she is temporarily the leader of the rebel faction of cylons that makes peace with the human fleet but when the first earth is found to be devastated ruin she decides to stay there and die rather than continuing the cycle of death exodus and rebirth threes are played by lucy lawless number four simon neill neill poses as human physician who treats starbuck for gunshot wound in what was supposedly resistance hospital on caprica the farm in reality this was cylon farm set up to breed human cylon hybrids using captured humans simon performed invasive tests on starbuck reproductive organs he was revealed to be the th model in the episode six of one fours are consistently medical specialists another four poses as married man in the colonial fleet cavil at one point asks simon to leave his life behind and destroy the ship he lives on he defies this order to protect his wife and her child by committing suicide and flying out of an air lock he was not close enough to resurrection ship and therefore died permanently the plan fours are played by rick worthy number five aaron doral doral debuts as public relations worker for the abortive galactica museum miniseries another five sneaks aboard the galactica and detonates an explosive litmus this event prompts the fleet wide announcement that cylons can have human appearance he was revealed to be the th model in the episode downloaded during the occupation of new caprica the fives are anti human and aggressive they specialize in public relations and control using large scale events and media manipulation fives are played by matthew bennett number six caprica six shelly godfrey gina inviere natalie faust lida sonja the first model explicitly revealed to be cylon in the mini series sixes often use seduction to their advantage important copies include shelly godfrey gina inviere head six caprica six and natalie caprica six one of the sixes later known as caprica six on her way to meet with baltar murders an infant by breaking its neck this could either be considered sociopathic or mercy killing due to the coming cylon attack she saves baltar life when his house was struck by blast wave from the cylon attack caprica six has love hate relationship with baltar alternately defending him to other cylon models or leaving him to suffer at their hands reincarnation of caprica six commits the first incident of cylon on cylon violence killing three with rock to save ander life caprica six was imprisoned on galactica after helping athena escape from the cylons with hera she offers to testify against baltar while in the brig she has relationship with saul tigh that results in the first cylon cylon pregnancy in years which ends in miscarriage caprica six has an inner baltar which only she sees similar to how baltar has an inner six that only he can see inner baltar serves as sort of conscience for caprica six and as an advisor in times of trouble as inner six does for him inner baltar appears at least once to baltar himself before their true nature is revealed speculation rises that baltar is cylon inner baltar and inner six appear to baltar and caprica six all four sharing moment together as the first part of the revelation that the inners are divine beings referred to as angels manipulating both the colonials and cylons into fulfilling god plan series finale shelly godfrey godfrey was on galactica after the cylon attack she accused baltar of treasonously sabotaging human defenses and therefore of killing several million people six degrees of separation she also appears in battlestar galactica the plan tv movie gina inviere gina acted as contractor for pegasus and was in relationship with admiral cain when cain discovered that gina was cylon agent she ordered her crew to push her programming in an attempt to see if gina was vulnerable to emotional trauma gina later escaped with baltar aid assassinated cain and founded resistance group in the fleet preaching peace with the cylons while it seemed that gina developed feelings for baltar and wanted to pursue him she detonated nuclear warhead provided by baltar that destroyed cloud nine other fleet ships and generated an electromagnetic signature the detection of which ultimately led the cylon fleet to new caprica sonja and natalie other important sixes include natalie who originally leads the rebel cylon faction against cavil faction before she is killed by athena in and sonja who was elected to represent the rebel cylons in the colonial fleet quorum of ships captains sixes are played by tricia helfer number seven daniel daniel was the seventh cylon model no exit ellen refers to daniel as an artist and so sensitive to the world she was very close to daniel which enraged cavil he felt that daniel was ellen favorite and became jealous cavil poisoned the amniotic fluid used to mature the daniel copies and then corrupted daniel genetic code this sabotage meant that no further sevens could be created the original was also killed with samuel anders stating at one point that daniel died after regaining his true memories twelve models were active throughout the series rather than thirteen fans speculated that starbuck or her father was version of the corrupted seven line instead daniel is merely plot device to explain the missing number and to expand on cavil character noting that daniel is essentially the abel to cavil cain the sevens were springboard for caprica where daniel graystone is the name of main character played by eric stoltz this daniel is the creator of the colonial centurions sevens are never seen in the series and therefore not played by any actor number eight sharon boomer valerii sharon athena agathon at the end of the miniseries six says by your command to an eight this phrase is usually spoken to the imperious leader in the old series by centurions it seemed to give this particular eight leadership role boomer sharon boomer valerii first appears as raptor pilot aboard the galactica her true nature as cylon was revealed at the end of the miniseries she acted as sleeper agent unaware of her true nature and programmed to carry out attacks on the fleet without realizing what she is doing she was revealed to be an eight in the episode downloaded athena the other significant eight sharon athena agathon married karl helo agathon rebelled against the cylons and joined forces with the colonials her child with helo daughter named hera is the first cylon human hybrid such child is the subject of cylon prophecy its importance increased as it was child born of love shortly after hera birth roslin decides to mislead the cylons into believing the child has died her plan involves lying to athena and helo and giving the child to an adoptive mother maya while aiding the colonials in their plan to rescue the humans on new caprica athena sneaks into cylon storage facility and steals launch codes for the civilian ships trapped on new caprica she is discovered by anna who informs her that hera is still alive citing strange dreams and prophecy by human mystic as proof athena believing this to be ruse kneecaps anna during the exodus from new caprica hera caregiver is killed and anna finds the baby boomer later tells athena that hera lives athena has helo kill her athena allowing her to download into new body within the cylon fleet with the help of caprica six she rescues hera and returns to galactica eight is described as weak by baltar head six and eights usually appear more compassionate and sympathetic than other cylons however they fully supported the destruction of the colonies the actions of boomer and an eight who had duplicitous affair with felix gaeta on new caprica make it clear that eights are capable of homicide and betrayal eights are also capable of intense loyalty and have the ability to break from cylon traditions and laws to help human friends or family they vote to save humanity in the cylon civil war that boomer starts she hesitates for while when cavil influences her but in the end chooses to support the humans even if it means that she must give up her life athena becomes completely assimilated in human culture her child and husband become her life focus she is the only cylon to create family the eight perceived fragility camouflage great strength and direction in one episode athena hardwires herself to galactica hacks into cylon fleet and shuts them down eights are played by grace park final five cavil killed and boxed the final five later he resurrected them purged their memories and sent them to live among the humans the other six models had no knowledge of the final five identities presumably blocked by cavil though they were aware of the existence of five absent models who were not to be spoken of when anna three attempts to learn their identities cavil boxes her entire model line as punishment in the final episode of the third season four of the final five are revealed to be characters with long histories on the galactica their purpose and how and why they were hidden from the rest of their kind is major plot point of the fourth and final season when ellen tigh is revealed to be the fifth member the final five cylons drawn in crude sketch by three backstory the final five were cylon models who could not be named or researched by skinjobs rapture they were the original humanoid cylons born years before the series on earth as part of the thirteenth tribe sometimes great notion they were born to cylon parents through sexual reproduction rather than built they were the researchers who rebuilt the cylon resurrection technology that had been abandoned when the thirteenth tribe gained the ability to procreate saul and ellen were married at the time while tyrol and foster were in love and planned to marry no exit while on earth the final five learned of the upcoming attack on the colonies from beings angels only they can see they placed the resurrection technology on ship in earth orbit when the nuclear attack kills them they resurrect on the ship and head for the colonies to warn them they arrive during the first cylon war unbeknownst to the humans and make deal with the centurions stop the war and they will help them build human bodies they build the first model one cavil who helps them build seven other models sometimes great notion cavil then kills and boxes the five and removes the memory of their identities from the other cylons he later unboxes them replacing their memories cavil periodically seeds them among the human populations starting with saul and then ellen to show them the evils of humanity the five are fully cylon although fundamentally different from the others unlike the other models they do not have model numbers other cylons do not talk about the five torn identities saul tigh michael hogan and galen tyrol aaron douglas are galactica officers while samuel anders michael trucco is an athlete on caprica tory foster rekha sharma is political operative who is rescued from caprica and works for roslin ellen tigh kate vernon is the fifth member as saul later realizes as more of his memory returns sometimes great notion ellen resurrected after she is poisoned by saul for giving rescue mission plan to cavil on new caprica this restores her memory of her life as cylon no exit story the five awaken when they begin to hear strange music this seems to affect other cylons raider scans anders and disengages an attack aboard galactica caprica six tells roslin that she can feel the final five and that they are near he that believeth in me twos sixes and eights believe that the raiders called off the attack because they sensed the final five something with which the ones fours and fives disagree this disagreement leads directly to the cylon civil war in which the twos sixes and eights rebel six of one standoff between galactica and the rebel baseship exposes the four as cylons to the humans but lee adama in his capacity as acting president grants them amnesty as part of an alliance revelations only anders and ellen regain their complete memories when anders gets shot in the head it seems to break cavil block on his memory while ellen resurrection restores all of her memories cavil had planned for the five to die in the destruction of the colonies download regain their true memories and apologize for their faith in humanity the plan instead four of the final five survive the destruction of the colonies without resurrecting tigh and tyrol were on galactica and tory and anders survived through luck while cavil kept ellen alive so she could suffer more and learn her lesson cavils plan thus fails as all of the five with the possible exception of foster maintain their loyalty to humanity they play major role in ending the second war taking prominent role in the battle of the colony especially anders who acts as galactica hybrid and shuts down the colony weapons and hybrids the five also nearly bring peace between human and cylon by exchanging resurrection technology which can only be rebuilt by the combined knowledge of the five for peace they see each other memories and tyrol learns that tory had murdered his wife in rage he strangles her shattering the temporary peace although fortuitous nuclear explosion and cavil subsequent suicide effectively ends the war moments later after escaping and reaching new earth anders flies the fleet into the sun destroying it and himself leaving only three of the final five alive hybrids the hybrids resemble human beings inside an immersion tank similar to cylon rebirthing tank the hybrids are cyborgs consisting of conduits and other connectors mated to biological elements the hybrid is not one of the thirteen models it represents step on the path from mechanical centurion to partially bio mechanical raider to hybrid to skinjob hybrids are so integrated into the basestar functionality that they are for all practical purposes its brains hybrids continually speak what most of the humanoid cylons consider to be gibberish although there is some difference of opinion on this point many cylons believe hybrid conscious mind is completely mad and the functions it performs are part of deeper state of mind in connection with the ship caprica six states that the conoy model believes that every word hybrid says is channeled from the cylon god hybrid is not allowed to vote in the cylon democratic process though it sometimes objects to the resulting decisions for example leaving another basestar full of disease infected cylons to their fates one hybrid considered the first hybrid in cylon lore was the result of experiments on humans during the first cylon war and appears to be more coherent and prophetic than the others it went rogue as early as the end of the first war and is protected by model cylons called guardians who consider it their god according to the skinjobs the first hybrid and its guardians are legends the colonial fleet accidentally clashes with the guardians destroying them the first hybrid along with its basestar the first hybrid has the appearance of an old man whereas the standard hybrids look like young women and are identical after he is shot in the head and enters vegetative state samuel anders is connected to datastream and as result develops hybrid like abilities whereupon he acts as galactica hybrid when hooked up he speaks and acts like hybrid this shows that apparently under special circumstances normal cylons or at least the final five can become hybrid like beings the basestar hybrids are played by tiffany lyndall knight the first hybrid is played by campbell lane religion humanoid cylons except for the cavil models follow monotheistic religion religious fanaticism partially motivates their attempted genocide of humanity despite their origins the cylons believe themselves to be spiritual beings this monotheism seems to share some of the characteristics as the abrahamic religions belief that god is omniscient omnipotent omnibenevolent that he will one day deliver divine retribution and that he intervenes in the mundane world their beliefs are different from the abrahamic religions in that they deal with issues such as consciousness enlightenment and reincarnation moore said that this spirituality comes when species becomes sentient and self aware questioning faith and religion and about what happens after death the different cylon models have slightly different ways of talking about and dealing with their god reflecting the different aspects of humanity that each cylon model reflects ones do not all believe in god and can be agnostic or atheist in contrast twos are fanatically religious vulnerabilities some cylons are physically stronger than humans while this is obvious with respect to centurions the extent to which the twelve are also is unclear in the miniseries william adama fought with two who despite suffering from the effects of radiation proved to be stronger the two managed to break off metal pipe to use as club and lift adama off the floor with one arm another two was able to break apart pair of metal handcuffs while under interrogation flesh and bone six engaged kara thrace hand to hand and proved to be exceptionally fast agile and strong kobol last gleaming ii despite this cylons are vulnerable to most of the same things as humans the two who fought adama was beaten to death with flashlight while the six who fought thrace was impaled by piece of rebar while the twelve may match or exceed human strength they do not display superhuman powers or resilience cylon skin appears just as vulnerable to breaking as human skin bleeding just as comparable wound would in human cylon mental faculties are sufficiently similar to those of human to allow for manipulation cain and thrace exploited this fact while interrogating cylons the experience of death even with resurrection is traumatic and can leave deep emotional damage cylons are susceptible to an ancient virus that can be transmitted by rodents to which humans are immune lymphocytic encephalitis this virus was carried on beacon left by the thirteenth tribe at the lion head nebula millennia before and disrupts all organic cylon technology including raiders hybrids which in turn disrupts centurions and the skinjobs the humans speculate that the beacon was accidentally contaminated when someone sneezed the cylons believe that critical symptom of this virus harmful bioelectric feedback can be transmitted during download and attempt to prevent infected cylons from downloading the only immune cylon is athena who had given birth to half human child and thus inherited human antibodies from her offspring although it is unclear whether she retained this immunity after downloading dr cottle developed vaccine after some twelves were infected on basestar near the lion head nebula the disease requires regular booster shots to keep an infected cylon healthy the cylons failed to develop cure or vaccine to the virus cylons silica pathways are affected by certain forms of radiation such as that surrounding ragnar anchorage it is assumed but not stated that this radiation affects all of the skinjobs as the station was chosen as refuge by commander adama before he learned of the existence of biomechanical models the radiation had deleterious effects on the two they found at ragnar anchorage but not on adama this suggests that humans are not vulnerable to this type of radiation plutonium is used for baltar cylon detector because its radiation affects humans and cylons differently the detector was dropped as method of exposing hidden cylons early in season as the revelation that boomer test subject was cylon convinced the command staff that the detector did not work see also cylon vessels basestar controlled by hybrids

      "little switzerland or schweiz is landscape often of wooded hills this romantic aesthetic term is not geographic category but was widely used in the th century to connote dramatic natural scenic features that would be of interest to tourists since it was ambiguous from the very beginning it was flexibly used in travel writing to imply that landscape had some features though on much smaller scale that might remind visitor of switzerland rock outcrops the bastei saxon switzerland rock of oëtre norman switzerland the original generic term was applied to dozens of locations in europe the bulk of them german speaking as well as to other parts of the world to direct attention to rock outcrops that stand out usually amid steep forest the original th century comparison was usually with the fissured crags of the jura mountains on the franco swiss border which hardly rise higher than metres histories of saxon switzerland sächsische schweiz in saxony germany assert that the landscape description schweiz arose there at the end of the th century schweiz is the german language name of switzerland the term was used both alone and with the prefix little for example in the title of an german book length poem die kleine schweiz by jakob reiselsberger which praised the rocky scenery of part of franconia in germany known thereafter as the franconian switzerland fränkische schweiz the term was already colloquial by this time in english in correspondent asserted in the gentleman magazine that steep area by the road outside petersfield in southern england was little switzerland the aesthetic term to describe picturesque exposed rock and steepness rather than altitude was also in common use in other european languages including the french term suisse rocks and wild landscapes were favoured theme in romantic painting the many english places praised in th century promotional literature as little switzerland include church stretton whitfield and the coastal area around the north devon twin towns of lynton and lynmouth chalet style buildings were sometimes erected to emphasize little switzerland pretensions for example at matlock bath which unusually for england also features cable car mountains from the beginning the term was often understood as comparison to the snow capped alps rather than to the jura the following passage describing wales appears in an english language edition of malte brun universal geography which had originally been written in french in describing the atlantic island of st helena in new voyage round the world otto von kotzebue and johann friedrich eschscholtz were translated into english as writing in the united states the raw white mountains of new hampshire which were soon to be one of the definitive subjects of american romantic painting were termed little switzerland by travel writer henry tudor as early as lakelands lake plön in holstein switzerland in the later th century authors and tourism promoters would praise picture postcard summer scenery of woods and low hills reflected in blue lakes as little switzerland or schweiz whereas the earlier use had implied landscape of dangers this was term for beauty this usage reflected today in the official geographical terms for the holstein switzerland holsteinische schweiz and mecklenburg switzerland schweiz in germany where there are neither mountains nor outcrops is difficult to account for but may refer to prestigious swiss lakeside tourist destinations such as zurich lucerne or interlaken or to lakes geneva and constance official names the term has often appeared anachronistic since travel to switzerland became affordable by the st century it was common for observers to express puzzlement that the little switzerland label applied at all to regions such as the suisse normande or to the holstein switzerland where the flat hilltops are no more than metres above the lake surfaces in the swiss tourism federation counted more than places round the world that had at least for some period been named after switzerland either because of fancied scenic resemblance in jest or referring to banking haven political neutrality or habitation by swiss emigrants no fewer than places in neighbouring germany were said by the federation to have adopted little switzerland names while the byname has fallen out of fashion in some places it persists as the

      "the battle of karanovasa lit battle of the trenches took place on october between the wallachian army led by voivode mircea cel bătrân against an ottoman invasion led by sultan bayezid this battle is sometimes confused with the later battle of rovine lit battle of the marshes rovine is old romanian latin for ruins modern italian rovinare to tear down between the same combatants and which took place also along the valley of the argeş river background the ottoman empire emerged as small principality in the early fourteenth century in the northwestern part of the anatolian peninsula in the following decades the ottoman sultans combined their growing military strength with astute dynastic politics to expand their territory eastwards into the whole of anatolia and westwards into the balkan peninsula thus in murad conquered much of greece and fought large christian army at the battle of kosovo in in the early his successor bayezid established his suzerainty over stefan lazarević of serbia the turnovo bulgaria of ivan shishman and the vidin despotate of ivan sratsimir the ottoman empire had become one of the most important powers in the balkans threatening the remaining independent states of central europe wallachia moldavia the kingdom of hungary as well as the venetian colonies in the aegean sea mircea of wallachia previously secured an alliance with several karamanid princes of anatolia which antagonized bayezid yet bayezid despite defeating the karamanids had to plan and act every action carefully since he had more enemies than friends among the muslim turkish aristocracy and could not simply turn around and declare new holy war against those whose troops helped the karamanid princes in anatolia his opportunity came when the wallachians and the hungarians invaded the weak states from the south of the danube which were vassals of bayezid the wallachians occupied the principality of karvuna and the city of silistra apparently with the consent of ivan shishman while the hungarians tried to conquer the vidin despotate these infringements on his vassals lands gave bayezid authority to move returning from asia minor to the balkans in the sultan expelled the wallachians from silistra and the dobruja and declared that turnovo tsardom unable to fend for herself was now an ottoman pashalik the final attack on wallachia was to take place the battle in the autumn of after raiding campaign along the right bank of the danube bayezid launched the attack on wallachia he commanded the ottoman rumelian army and the armies of his balkan vassals most of which were bulgarians and serbs under stefan lazarević the son of the late serbian prince lazar the armies crossed the danube at nicopolis at advanced along the argeş river with the intention of capturing curtea de argeş the capital city of wallachia after weeklong march in which the constant attacks wallachian took their toll the wallachian army met the ottoman one on october the wallachians launched sudden ambush from the forests slowly pushing the ottomans closely to the bank of the argeş river the bloodiest fighting took place around the ottoman camp strengthened with earth walls palisades and ditches hendek in turkish hence the name with which this battle appears in serbian chronicles as the battle of the trenches of karanovasa surrounded the ottomans managed to resist until the dawn when bayiezid hardly managed to escape the battle fleeing over the danube nevertheless most of his and his vassals armies perished including the serbian kings son marko kraljević aftermath it would turn out that his vassals suffered more from the sultans help than they did from the wallachians and hungarians the turnovo tsardom not only ceased its existence but ivan shishman was accused of collaboration with the enemy and was executed at the orders of the sultan bayezid spent the winter and the spring warring in anatolia with seljuk princes besieging constantinople and leaving the lands south of the danube in the hands of mircea who by now managed to provoke an anti ottoman rebellion as far south as rumelia much better prepared attack in which the entire ottoman army as well as the whole of the ottoman vassals took part was started by the sultan in spring in may the alliance documents signed at brașov on march between mircea and sigismund of luxembourg reveal that by huge concentration of ottoman forces took place in the southern dobruja the ottoman army launched two directional attack via nicopolis and via vidin craiova another ottoman army group led by vlad of wallachia mircea nephew who was attempting to take the throne with turkish support was invading along the ialomiţa river faced with much larger force mircea applied guerrilla tactics and

      "this article examines recycling in the united states in the recycling rate in the us was since there is no national law that mandates recycling state and local governments often introduce their own recycling requirements number of states including california connecticut delaware hawaii iowa maine massachusetts michigan new york oregon and vermont have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers while other jurisdictions rely on recycling goals or landfill bans of recyclable materials national efforts collection center for recyclables in santa monica california usa on national level the united states environmental protection agency epa oversees variety of waste issues these include regulation of hazardous wastes landfill regulations and setting recycling goals more specific recycling legislation is localized through city or state governments state regulation falls into two major categories landfill bans and recycling goals landfill bans make it illegal to dispose of enumerated items in landfill most often these items include yard waste oil and recyclables easily collected in curbside recycling programs states with landfill bans of recyclables include wisconsin minnesota michigan and north carolina other states focus on recycling goals these include california and illinois one ways in which some states encourage recycling of specific drink containers is through the passage of bottle bill number of states such as california hawaii oregon connecticut delaware maine vermont massachusetts iowa michigan and new york have passed laws that establish deposits or refund values on beverage containers in order to promote reuse and recycling most are five cents per can or bottle michigan has maintained cent deposit value for bottles and cans since mandatory recycling some cities such as seattle and states like connecticut have created mandatory recycling laws that may fine citizens who throw away certain percentage of recyclable materials in their garbage waste vermont also employed landfill ban of recyclable materials food and yard waste and wood there are also voluntary programs and educational programs to increase recycling where it is not mandated by law disposal of recyclables in the garbage is prohibited from households businesses and apartments for businesses that would include prohibiting the disposal of cardboard paper and yard waste in the garbage for apartments and houses disposal of glass paper cardboard aluminum and plastic in the garbage would be prohibited with businesses and apartments if garbage collectors find more than percent of the container filled with recyclables they will leave tag on the third tag the business or apartment tenants will receive fine however households do not face the risk of being fined if trash collectors find over percent of their garbage contains recyclables they will leave tag asking the household to separate the garbage and recyclables for collection the next week criticism of mandatory recycling in article in the new york times john tierney claimed that government mandated recycling wastes more resources than it saves tierney article received referenced critique from the environmental defense fund which noted that the article relied heavily on quotes and information supplied by group of consultants and think tanks that have strong ideological objections to recycling or vested financial interest in opposing it in daniel benjamin professor of economics at clemson university published paper through the property and environment research center that reiterated many of the points brought up in the new york times article backing them up with detailed inquiry into the recycling industry of the us in he followed up on that with an updated look into the recycling policies of the us finding that not much has changed financial implications when the recycling industry was in its infancy in the united states the financial costs of collecting depositing and processing recyclables exceeded that of trash disposal some opponents of recycling argued that state support for recycling may be more financially expensive in the short term than alternatives such as landfill disposal for example recycling efforts in new york city cost million per year in and by it cost the city more to recycle each ton of waste than to dump it in landfill to refute this argument people pointed out that the social benefits to society from recycling compensate for any difference in cost landfilling waste is an inefficient use of resources contributes to global warming through the release of methane into the atmosphere when unharvested or incompletely harvested and by the pollution of groundwater and waterways the long term financial and social costs of pollution caused by landfilling waste are often not taken into consideration however in many regions of the country there are now an economic incentives to recycle as early as fort worth texas was making from their recycling program similarly waukesha county recycling program in wisconsin began operating with positive revenues in most recently waukesha county began receiving per ton bonus for recyclables coming into their private mrf materials recycling facility combining that with the average revenue from the sale of the materials minus the long term costs incurred if the items had been landfilled the average total lost revenue county share for recyclables thrown in the landfill is recycling status recycling statistics recycling materials waiting to be barged away on the chicago river recycling statistics ca an average of approximately million tons of trash is generated by the united states in was recycled was combusted for energy recovery was landfilled of trash is generated per capita per day in the united states recycled materials going to landfill the new york times reported in may that in somes cases of all recyclables collected are sent to landfill recycling by material type recycling rates vary by material and product type of paper of steel of glass of aluminum of plastics waste electronic waste or waste describes discarded electrical or electronic devices used electronics which are destined for reuse resale salvage recycling or disposal are also considered waste informal processing of waste in developing countries can lead to adverse human health effects and environmental pollution electronic scrap components such as cpus contain potentially harmful components such as lead cadmium beryllium or brominated flame retardants recycling and disposal of waste may involve significant risk to workers and communities in developed countries and great care must be taken to avoid unsafe exposure in recycling operations and leaking of materials such as heavy metals from landfills and incinerator ashes according to the environmental protection agency epa it is important to dispose of electronics via recycling because electronic products are made from valuable resources and materials including metals plastics and glass all of which require energy to mine and manufacture donating or recycling consumer electronics conserves our natural resources and avoids air and water pollution as well as greenhouse gas emissions that are caused by manufacturing virgin materials consumer recycling options include donating equipment directly to organizations in need sending devices directly back to their original manufacturers or getting components to convenient recycler or refurbisher tires the environmental protection agency reports million scrap tires were generated in of the million million of these scrap tires were used to make automotive and truck tire re treads with landfills minimizing their acceptance of whole tires and the health and environmental risks of stockpiling tires many new markets have been created for scrap tires growing markets exist for majority of scrap tires produced every year supported by state and local government tires are also often recycled for use on basketball courts and new shoe products however material recovered from waste tires known as crumb is generally only cheap filler material and is rarely used in high volumes tires are not desired at landfills due to their large volumes and void space which quickly consumes valuable space as of states banned whole tires from landfills allowed shredded tires banned all tires from landfills allowed processed tires in mono fills and states had no restrictions on scrap tires in landfills the united states has decreased the number of waste tires in storage from million in down to million tires in primarily due to state scrap management programs local government us state laws and regulations dealing with scrap tires are currently enacted in states here are some common features of state programs that deal with scrap tires source of funding for the program licensing or registration of scrap tire haulers processors and end users manifests for scrap tire shipments limitations on who may handle scrap tires financial assurance requirements for scrap tire handlers and market development activities some state programs are now supported by fees charged to the consumer at purchase or disposal of each tire these fees sometimes called tipping fees help to support recycling costs when the disposal rates charged to consumers are set high this in turn discourages landfill disposal simple solution encouraging more affordable tire recycling programs early history the first recorded mass recycling program in the ban the can was conceived and executed in by ruth pat webb in honolulu hawaii she organized military and civilian volunteers to collect over tons of metal cans from the roadways and highways of oahu the metal cans were later recycled into steel reinforcement bars to be used in local construction projects the stanolind recycling plant was in operation as early another early recycling mill was waste techniques built in conshohocken pennsylvania in waste techniques was sold to frank keel in and resold to bfi in woodbury new jersey was the first city in the united states to mandate recycling led by donald sanderson who was president of woodbury city council and woodbury recycling committee in the early the idea of towing recycling trailer behind waste management vehicle to enable the collection of trash and recyclable material at the same time emerged other towns and cities soon followed suit and today many cities in the make recycling requirement in the mobro barge hauled garbage from new york to north carolina where it was denied it was then sent to belize where it was denied as well finally the barge returned to new york and the garbage was incinerated the incident led to heated discussions in the media about waste disposal and recycling the incident is often referred to as igniting the recycling hysteria of the recycling education integrating recycling into educational system has become goal for many educators usually it is integrated into science or social studies classrooms this is due to its inclusion in the national education standards for both of these subject areas common areas that recycling is integrated into the curriculum include areas such as the study of natural resources general environmental units soil units water units community units economic units and geography units although interest is growing major textbook publishers do not always include recycling in textbook so teachers are left to supplement the textbooks with outside curriculum to meet the national standards for example in unit about trees or natural resources teachers could include supplemental curriculum about recycling because in the textbook it is never explicitly covered non profit organizations as well as governmental organizations have created supplemental curriculum for teachers to fill this void some purely non profit groups include the center for new american dream and be smart other creators of curriculum include governmental offices some of these include oregon california and waukesha county wisconsin also some non profit organizations have partnered with sections of the government to collaborate on educational materials for example the keystone center partnered with the united

      "figure riding sea turtle probably depicting an ancient greek fable similar to ulysses return to the homeland nostos nostos ancient greek is theme used in greek literature which includes an epic hero returning home by sea it is high level of heroism or greatness this journey is usually very extensive and includes being shipwrecked in an unknown location and going through certain trials that test the hero the return isn just about returning home physically but also about retaining certain statuses and retaining your identity upon arrival the theme of nostos is brought to life in homer the odyssey where the main hero odysseus tries to return home after battling in the trojan war odysseus is challenged by many temptations such as the sirens and the lotus eaters if odysseus had given into these temptations it would have meant certain death and thus failing to return home nostos is used today in many forms of literature and movies nostos in the odyssey in the odyssey homer has nostos being the return home from troy by sea nostos can be told by those who experienced it themselves or there are simply instances in which it is present those who told their adventures on the sea on their journey back home from troy were menelaus nestor and odysseus those three recount their adventures to others in the epic with menelaus in book four he tells of his time in egypt and other irregular stops he did not stop at just his nostos but he told of agamemnon fatal nostos in great detail as well as small section of odysseus journey nestor gives more on menelaus nostos and his journey home with odysseus and menelaus in book three nestor said we pondered our long sea voyage whether we should sail over the top of rocky chios by the island psyros keeping it on our left hand or else to pass under chios by windy mimas we asked the god to give us some portent for sign and the god gave us one and told us to cut across the middle main sea for euboia and so most quickly escape the hovering evil here nestor made it evident to the audience that his and diomedes journey home was perfect nostos they had no real issues which was quite different from agamemnon this great difference shows how different each hero journey home could be in these instances where nostos is simply present and not told by the individual in the odyssey there is an intention to reach specific destination and some other force blowing the characters off course and arrive in unexpected places on their journey to their home the odyssey had several different instances of nostos one specific instance where odysseus companions lost their nostos was when they ate helios cattle and were killed for this since they were specifically told not to odysseus warned the men when he said friends since there is food and drink stored in the fast ship let us then keep our hands off the cattle for fear that something may befall us these are the cattle and fat sheep of dreaded god helios who sees all things and listens to all things at that point odysseus warns the men of what will happen if they eat the cattle yet they do anyway this situation took away their nostos because their journey home came to an end not all greek heroes experience nostos achilles nostos is unique in the iliad this is because he knows himself that he will not have nostos creating greater difference between him and the other heroes such as odysseus achilles knows that he has two options when it comes to the trojan war he can either die in the battle with glory and have short life or not participate and live long yet insignificant life in the ninth book he says my nostos has perished but my kleos will be unwilting in this instance he has chosen the route of glory and says he will not now return home because it is destined that he will die in battle nostos and odysseus odysseus was able to tell his own story of his nostos since he has survived odysseus was able to tell part of his nostos to the phaeacians and the length of his journey shows how difficult it can be to achieve nostos this arrival and telling of his tales is big deal though he has not reached home it is huge mile marker after odysseus and his companions leave circe palace safely his crew members show their happiness by saying we rejoice for you saved yourself nourished by zeus as much as if we had reached ithaca which shows the comparison of escaping to returning home nostos meant several different things in this epic it meant escaping death safe landings returning home from war and being back home all of those come through because as the hero returned from war the idea of escaping death from war remained in their forethought these meanings all resemble nostos and when heroes are on their journey back they will have the ultimate kleos once they have arrived and that is celebrated modern times the word nostalgia was first coined as medical term in by johannes hofer swiss medical student it uses the word νόστος along with another greek root άλγος or algos meaning pain to describe the psychological condition of longing for the past in james joyce ulysses the final part during which leopold bloom returns home is called the nostos another depiction of nostos in contemporary media would be the example of the movie hercules unchained which was released in this movie was similar to the odyssey hercules journey was very similar to odysseus one specific instance being when hercules returned home with iole whom he won in an archery contest which is similar to odysseus contest to save his marriage he was accidentally poisoned by his wife and asked to have his body set on fire having his body set on fire is what led to his many heroic achievements during that time period there were no other films like this one that depicted this type of ancient material hercules nostos had him die and then be reborn this is to rediscover his identity within himself and the community this is similar to odysseus because he transforms personally from war machine to family man the tv series star trek voyager in which the titular spacecraft is stranded light years from earth and encounters numerous hostile and friendly aliens and strange phenomena on its way home has been described by classicists as nostos see also hero journey nostoi references\n",

scientific book toward the light in danish vandrer mod lyset first published by michael agerskov in copenhagen in early life she was daughter of dutch inventor minister and principal of the royal institute for deaf mutes in copenhagen rasmus malling hansen in her younger days johanne agerskov worked as teacher and she married michael agerskov in their only daughter inger agerskov was born in and johanne became housewife spiritualism during the first decade of the twentieth century michael became interested in spiritual phenomena and persuaded his wife to participate in séances even though she was skeptical in the beginning soon johanne came to believe that the spirits of the transcendental world had called upon her and had given her the message that she was medium and that before her birth she had promised to be instrumental in bringing eternal truths to mankind convinced that she had special mission agerskov and her husband formed circle with two more couples and for many years held weekly séances in which they believed messages from the spirits of the light were given to agerskov through intuitive thought inspiration she claimed unique ability to close off her own thoughts so that all she could hear in her mind according to her was the thoughts of the spirit with whom she was supposed to be in contact that was very demanding and in that period she gave up all the pleasures of social life in order to be focused and prepared for the séances the members of the circle would submit questions for her to ask the spirits and shortly she would give them answers supposedly from the spirits which the other participants would write down message to mankind that resulted in the publication of the book toward the light which agerskov called message to mankind from the transcendental world and which she and her husband sent out to all the bishops and sixty ministers of the danish national church their hope was that these would participate in reformation of the danish church based upon the new knowledge given in toward the light the agerskovs made great efforts to that end through correspondence and by opening their home to anybody who wanted to see them about toward the light but there was little public interest in the book and the expected reformation did not take place johanne agerskov was also deeply engaged in the work of her father in danish professor asserted that malling hansen was not the inventor of the hansen writing ball and agerskov undertook thorough investigation of the facts together with her sister engelke wiberg they wrote several articles on the subject and agerskov also wrote book called hvem var skrivekuglens opfinder who was the inventor of the writing ball published in copenhagen in later life in society for the advancement of toward the light was formed which offered religious services for its members based on toward the light agerskov was skeptical however because toward the light calls on believers to remain in the established church and to work for reformation from within even though the agerskovs in the beginning had participated in spiritualist séances they soon asked their followers to end that activity because as they asserted in toward the light calling on the spirits of deceased ancestors would bring problems to those who could not resist the call to appear the spirits they said needed to rest and to prepare for their next incarnation and were not allowed to visit the earth michael agerskov died in but johanne continued to answer letters and to publish up until in collaboration with their daughter during the last years of her life johanne agerskov suffered from illness and was not able to leave her home photos of johanne agerskov there has been controversy among agerskov followers over whether or not to publish photos of her as she said to destroy all her own pictures of herself before she died some of the followers of toward the light contend that her will in this matter should be respected and oppose the publication of such pictures others see nothing wrong with publishing photos of her considering that photos of her are available in public collections in both

exposure also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages which contributes to market stability in regard to the financial market net positions are vital difference between set off and netting whilst netting and set off are often used interchangeably the legal distinction is made between netting which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing set off by contrast set off describes the legal bases for producing net positions netting describes the form such as novation netting or close out netting whilst set off describes judicially recognised grounds such as independent set off or insolvency set off therefore netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counter party to address counter party credit risk this is to be differentiated from hedging which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk mutuality the law does not permit counter parties to use third party debt to set off against an un related liability all forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim this protects property rights both inside insolvency and out primarily by ensuring that non owner cannot benefit from insolvency market effect the primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties this prevents credit risk exposure and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherry picking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company netting at least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market specifically credit risk novation netting also called rolling netting netting by novation involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties this extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims this differs from settlement netting outlined below because the fusion of both claims into one producing single balance occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract this method of netting is crucial in financial settings particularly derivatives transactions as it avoids cherry picking in insolvency the effectiveness of pre insolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in british eagle international airlines ltd compagnie nationale air france wlr similar to settlement netting novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date this means that if in the above example transaction was to be paid on friday the two transactions would not offset novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations this is systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due close out netting an effective close out netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under master agreement similar to the one used by isda these traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency in the event of counterparty bankruptcy or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated effected all transactions or all of given type are netted set off against each other at market value or if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain market value at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract the alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to and thus potentially cherry pick there are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested the key elements of close out netting are default the accretion of the time for performance of obligations to the time of default conversion of non cash obligations into debts meaning obligations to deliver non cash assets are converted to market price equivalents and set off similar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such as repos forwards or options the effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the us and uk the mitigated systemic risk which is induced by close out scheme is protected legislatively other systemic challenges to netting such as regulatory capital recognition under basel ii and other insolvency related matters seen in the lamfalussy report has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform in england wales the effect of british eagle international airlines ltd compagnie nationale air france has largely been negated by part vii of the company act which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts in regard to the basel accords the first set of guidelines basel was missing guidelines on netting basel ii introduced netting guidelines settlement netting for cash settled trades this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions obligations are not modified under settlement netting which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged unlike close out netting settlement netting is only possible in relation to like obligations having the same settlement date these dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency but can be agreed in advance claims exist but are extinguished when paid to achieve simultaneously payment only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides this has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned british eagle these are routinely included within derivative transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the pre settlement exposure amount bilateral net settlement system settlement system in which every individual bilateral combination of participants settles its net settlement position on bilateral basis multilateral net settlement system settlement system in which each settling participant settles its own multilateral net settlement position typically by means of single payment or receipt set off set off is legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted of these legal bases common form is the legal defense of set off which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby person party who owed money to another party could be sent to debtors prison despite the fact that party also owed money to party the law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court this operated as an equitable shield but not sword upon judgment both claims are extinguished and replaced by single net sum owing if party owes party and party owes party the two sums are set off and replaced with single obligation of from party to party set off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that where party defaults the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished in certain jurisdictions including the uk certain types of set off takes place automatically upon the insolvency of company this means that for each party which is both creditor and debtor of the insolvent company mutual debts are set off against each other and then either the bankrupt creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid depending on which side owed the most the primary argument this has been criticized as an undeclared security interest that violates the principle of pari passu the alternative where creditor has to pay all its debts but receive only limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get poses the danger of knock on insolvencies and thus systemic market risk seven still three core reasons underpin and justify the use of set off first the law should uphold pre insolvency autonomy and set offs as parties invariably rely on the pre insolvency commitments this is core policy point second as matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs third managing risk particularly systemic risk is crucially clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house and seller and clearing out effect is automatic novation meaning all elements are internalised in current accounts can be in different currencies as long as they are converted at calculation the right to set off is particularly important when bank exposures are reported to regulatory authorities as is the case in the eu under financial collateral requirements if bank has to report that it has lent large sum to borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors is thus replaced the bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent less the value of the security taken set off by country two primary examples of set off rules are outlined below these are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the european union through the financial collateral directives english law set off under english law there are broadly five types of set off which have been recognised legal set off or independent set off what is known as statutory set off this arises where claim and counterclaim in court action are both liquidated sums or ascertained with certainty this is wider than insolvent set off but the claim and cross claim must be mutual and liquidated in such cases the court will simply set off the amounts and award net sum the two claims do not need to be intrinsically connected equitable set off or transaction set off outside of litigation where two mutual claims arise out of the same matter or sufficiently closely related matter and an injustice would be done if not enforced the claims will set off in equity both sums must be due and payable but may be for liquidated or unliquidated sums unlike independent set off this is not self executing contractual set off made by express agreement often netting will arise through express agreement to the parties the isda master agreement is an example of this type which is ineffective against an insolvent party but is often used to address pre insolveny credit risk and reduce the need for collateral banker set off or current account set off sometimes referred to as banker right to combine accounts this is special form of set off which is implied into contractual agreements with bankers and allows banks to offset sums in one account against another account which is overdrawn from the same client however the right cannot be exercised if one of the accounts is loan account or if the bank has agreed not to exercise the right or if the bank has notice that the sums in the account are for specific purpose or on trust for another party it is said to derive from bankers lien however this is misleading as it is only available where both accounts are maintained in the same capacity difference in currency will not prevent this right however insolvency set off it is perhaps the most expensive form of set off under section of the insolvency act where person goes into bankruptcy or company goes into liquidation mutual debts are automatically set off this is mandatory operation in bilateral situations whether the debt is liquidated or unliquidated does not matter and the set off will apply to future or contingent claims if the debts are provable insolvency set off operates on liquidation and administration where the administrator gives notice of his intention to make distribution the five types of set off are extremely important as matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered fundamental implied term it is an essential aspect for cross claims especially when there exits overlapping obligations common features of set off are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality us law set off see de magno united states cir district court had jurisdiction over claim involving va affirmative action against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its common law right of set off discussing similar language of predecessor statute see united states munsey trust co ct ed government has the same right which belongs to

      "in the sport of shinty there are several clubs which play under the banner of one of the scottish universities however these clubs are not always student teams in the strictest sense of the word and have long history of participation at national senior level since the introduction of summer season only the aberdeen university shinty club continues to play in the senior leagues although edinburgh glasgow and st andrews have all done so in the past varsity match with glasgow university in action against strathclyde university history scottish universities have played major role in shinty since the early days of the sport the university of aberdeen club was founded in and clubs were founded at universities of edinburgh and glasgow in the late victorian era aberdeen played in north competitions and edinburgh and glasgow competed in south competitions often these teams would compete in junior competitions but would also from time to time restrict themselves to the university littlejohn competition university of st andrews became the fourth and final team to enter league shinty in the late this meant that all four of scotland ancient universities had shinty team representing them the original three had varying degrees of success but won or appeared in the finals of several cup competitions as well as garnering league success throughout their league existence the littlejohn the littlejohn of invercharron vase is the trophy played for by the universities it was presented in and has been played for ever since the move to summer shinty and effects on university shinty the move to the summer season in the sport meant that of the four teams playing in the north and south leagues only the university of aberdeen continued to play on full time basis however the change in status means that players from clubs playing in the national leagues such as kingussie and fort william can now play for their university outwith the senior season previously these players could only compete in the annual one day littlejohn vase tournament they may now play in the winter university league the scottish universities also have representative side which

      "all saints day also known as all hallows day hallowmas feast of all saints or solemnity of all saints is christian festival celebrated in honour of all the saints known and unknown in western christianity it is celebrated on november by the roman catholic church the anglican communion the methodist church the lutheran church and other protestant churches the eastern orthodox church and associated eastern catholic churches celebrate it on the first sunday after pentecost oriental orthodox churches of chaldea and associated eastern catholic churches celebrate all saints day on the first friday after easter christian celebration of all saints day and all souls day stems from belief that there is powerful spiritual bond between those in heaven the church triumphant and the living the church militant in catholic theology the day commemorates all those who have attained the beatific vision in heaven it is national holiday in many historically catholic countries in methodist theology all saints day revolves around giving god solemn thanks for the lives and deaths of his saints including those who are famous or obscure as such individuals throughout the church universal are honoured such as paul the apostle augustine of hippo and john wesley in addition to individuals who have personally led one to faith in jesus such as one grandmother or friend in the western christian practice the liturgical celebration begins at vespers on the evening of october all hallows eve all saints eve and ends at the close of november it is thus the day before all souls day which commemorates the faithful departed in many traditions all saints day is part of the triduum of allhallowtide which lasts three days from october to november inclusive in the british isles it is known that churches were already celebrating all saints on november at the beginning of the th century to coincide or replace the celtic festival of samhain james frazer suggests that november was chosen because it was the date of the celtic festival of the dead samhain however ronald hutton points out that according to óengus of tallaght ca the th th century church in ireland celebrated all saints on april he suggests that november date was germanic rather than celtic idea in eastern europe and western asia the eastern orthodox church following the byzantine tradition commemorates all saints collectively on the first sunday after pentecost all saints sunday greek αγίων πάντων agiōn pantōn the feast of all saints achieved great prominence in the th century in the reign of the byzantine emperor leo vi the wise his wife empress theophano commemorated on december lived devout life after her death in her husband built church intending to dedicate it to her when he was forbidden to do so he decided to dedicate it to all saints so that if his wife were in fact one of the righteous she would also be honoured whenever the feast was celebrated according to tradition it was leo who expanded the feast from commemoration of all martyrs to general commemoration of all saints whether martyrs or not this sunday marks the close of the paschal season to the normal sunday services are added special scriptural readings and hymns to all the saints known and unknown from the pentecostarion in the late spring the sunday following pentecost saturday days after easter is set aside as commemoration of all locally venerated saints such as all saints of america all saints of mount athos etc the third sunday after pentecost may be observed for even more localised saints such as all saints of st petersburg or for saints of particular type such as new martyrs of the turkish yoke in addition to the mondays mentioned above saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the octoechos the celebration of november in lebanon as holiday is simply the influence of western catholic orders present in lebanon and is not maronite in origin the traditional maronite feast equivalent to the honor of all saints in their liturgical calendar is one of three sundays in preparation for lent called the sunday of the righteous and the just the following sunday is the sunday of the faithful departed similar to all souls day in western calendar in east syriac tradition the all saints day celebration falls on the first friday after resurrection sunday this is because all departed faithful are saved by the blood of jesus and they resurrected with the christ normally in east syriac liturgy the departed souls are remembered on friday church celebrates all souls day on friday before the beginning of great lent or great fast in western europe and the americas the christian holiday of all saints day falls on november followed by all souls day on november and is currently solemnity in the roman rite of the catholic church as well as principal feast of the anglican communion in the early days the christians were accustomed to solemnise the anniversary of martyr death for christ at the place of martyrdom in the th century neighbouring dioceses began to interchange feasts to transfer relics to divide them and to join in common feast as is shown by the invitation of st basil of caesarea to the bishops of the province of pontus in the persecution of diocletian the number of martyrs became so great that separate day could not be assigned to each but the church feeling that every martyr should be venerated appointed common day for all the first trace of this we find in antioch on the sunday after pentecost we also find mention of common day in sermon of st ephrem the syrian and in the th homily of st john chrysostom according to ephrem this feast was observed at edessa on may and john chrysostom says it was on the sunday after pentecost in constantinople as early as there is in the chaldean calendar commemoratio confessorum for the friday after easter on may or pope boniface iv consecrated the pantheon at rome to the blessed virgin and all the martyrs ordering an anniversary the feast of the dedication sanctae mariae ad martyres has been celebrated at rome ever since there is evidence that from the th to the th centuries there existed in certain places and at sporadic intervals feast date on may to celebrate the holy martyrs the origin of all saints day cannot be traced with certainty and it has been observed on various days in different places however there are some who maintain the belief that it has origins in the pagan observation of may the feast of the lemures in which the malevolent and restless spirits of the dead were propitiated some liturgiologists base the idea that this lemuria festival was the origin of that of all saints on their identical dates and on the similar theme of all the dead meanwhile others consider that may was perhaps deliberately chosen by the pope because of its celebration already established in the east the feast of all saints on its current date is traced to the foundation by pope gregory iii of an oratory in st peter for the relics of the holy apostles and of all saints martyrs and confessors of all the just made perfect who are at rest throughout the world with the date moved to november and the may feast suppressed this fell on the celtic holiday of samhain which had theme similar to the roman festival of lemuria but which was also harvest festival the irish having celebrated samhain in the past did not celebrate all hallows day on this november date as extant historical documents attest that the celebration in ireland took place in the spring the felire of oengus and the martyrology of tallaght prove that the early medieval churches in ireland celebrated the feast of all saints on april november festival of all the saints was already widely celebrated on november in the days of charlemagne it was made day of obligation throughout the frankish empire in by decree of louis the pious issued at the instance of pope gregory iv and with the assent of all the bishops which confirmed its celebration on november the octave was added by pope sixtus iv the festival was retained after the reformation in the calendar of the anglican church and in many lutheran churches in the lutheran churches such as the church of sweden it assumes role of general commemoration of the dead in the swedish calendar the observance takes place on the saturday between october and november in many lutheran churches it is moved to the first sunday of november in the church of england mother church of the anglican communion it is principal feast and may be celebrated either on november or on the sunday between october and november it is also celebrated by other protestants of the english tradition such as the united church of canada the methodist churches and the wesleyan church protestants disagree with the idea of saints as it is in the roman catholic tradition and generally commemorate all christians on all saints day if they observe all saints day at all they use it to remember all christians both past and present in the united methodist church all saints day is celebrated on the first sunday in november it is held not only to remember saints but also to remember all those who have died who were members of the local church congregation in some congregations candle is lit by the acolyte as each person name is called out by the clergy prayers and responsive readings may accompany the event often the names of those who have died in the past year are affixed to memorial plaque in many lutheran churches all saints day is celebrated the sunday after reformation is celebrated the date for reformation is october so reformation sunday is celebrated on or before october in most congregations the festival is marked as an occasion to remember the dead the names of those who have died from the congregation within the last year are read during worship and bell is tolled chime is played and or candle is lit for each name read while the dead are solemnly remembered during worship on all saints sunday the festival is ultimately celebration of christ victory over death though halloween has usually been seen an american influence in the philippines the country trick or treat traditions in undas are actually much older this tradition was derived from the pre colonial tradition with the same name today called pangangaluwa pangangaluluwa occurred when early filipinos visited houses swathed in blankets to represent ghosts of ancestor while singing it like pre colonial christmas caroling but during undas if the owner of the house fails to give biko or rice cakes the nangangaluluwa or person doing the pangangaluwa would play tricks and try to get the owner chicken this pre colonial practice is still being done in rural tagalog areas in luzon and outlying islands and other rural areas outside luzon in undas family members go to the cemetery where the body of the loved one rests it is believed that by going to the cemetery and offering food candles numerous species and formations of flowers and sometimes incense sticks the spirit of the loved one is appeased contrary the common belief this visitation practice is not an imported tradition prior to the establishment of coffins pre colonial filipinos were already practicing such tradition by visiting burial caves throughout the archipelago as confirmed by research conducted by the university of the philippines the tradition of atang is also practiced where food and other offerings should be put on specific area near the grave site if the family cannot go to the grave site specific area in the house is provided for the atang the exact date of undas today november is not pre colonial observance date it was an influence from mexico where the same day is known as the day of the dead pre colonial filipinos prefer going to the burial caves of the departed occasionally as they believe that aswang half vampire hald werewolf being would take the corpse of the dead if the body is not properly guarded the protection of the body of the loved one is called paglalamay however in some communities this paglalamay tradition is non existent and is replaced by other pre colonial traditions unique to each community the undas is also seen as family reunion where family members coming from various regions go back to their hometown to visit the grave of loved ones family members are expected to remain beside the grave for the entire day and socialize with each other to mend bonds and enhance family relations in some cases family members going to certain burial sites exceed one hundred people fighting in any form is prohibited during undas children have important roles during undas children are allowed to play with melted candles at front of each grave site where the melted wax from the candles are turned into round wax balls the round balls of wax symbolize the affirmation that everything goes back to where it began as the living will go back to ash where everything started in some cases families also light up candles at the front door of the home the number of candles is equevalent to the number of departed loved ones it is believed that this tradition aids departed loved ones to have more happy path in the afterlife customs all saints day at

      "the bretagne was fast gun three decker of the french navy designed by engineer jules marielle built as new capital ship meant to improve upon the very successful océan class while avoiding the weaknesses found on valmy she retained most of the océan design but ended up incorporating the philosophy of fast ship of the line pioneered by napoléon with rounded stern and two cylinder boiler steam engine allowing her speed of knots the propeller could be retracted to streamline the hull when sailing under sail only she took part in the crimean war in and and was decommissioned in she was then used as barracks and as schoolship for boys and sailors in brest struck from the navy lists in she was broken up the following year design and construction bretagne was the offspring of an attempt to improve upon the océan class by increasing the beam from to metres the budget initially allowed for construction of new three decker capital ship named terrible in brest but the ship was cancelled in to slim down expenses the budget then scheduled two ships named bretagne and desaix in honour of louis desaix to be built in brest and cherbourg respectively the order was placed on march the mediocre performances of valmy during her trials led to the navy shedding the capital ship design of the commission de paris and start back from sané océan design with only incremental modifications in late engineers de gasté responsible for bretagne and forquenot for desaix decided on reduction of the tumblehome by centimetres and on slight increase of the beam alterations thought safe as the two last ships of the océan design ville de paris and louis xiv had had their tumblehome reduced by centimetres with no ill effect an initial suggestion to fit the ships with shp steam engines allowing for speed of knots was declined as to minimise departures from sané design bretagne under construction in brest arsenal engraving in illustration bretagne was laid down on august and desaix on octobre on june the ministry of the navy suspended construction and required that the ships be lengthened by metres and that shp steam engines be incorporated brest responded to the requirements in september but at the same point dupuy de lôme fast ship of the line napoléon was completing her trials exhibiting such outstanding performances that on september the ministry cancelled the bretagne class and ordered existing sailing ships to be converted to steamers using as many existing parts as possible at this point the keel bow and aft of bretagne had been erected amounting to the third of the construction steps defined by regulations in ship construction she was taken apart and rebuilt according to marielle plans which had been approved in december at the same time the order for the steam engine was placed desaix whose keel was only beginning to be laid was cancelled altogether and arcole second ship of the algésiras type the production series of the napoléon design was started instead launching of bretagne took place on february in spite of snow and strong wind large populace gathered to watch the operation the new design gave length of metres and beam of this made bretagne metres longer and metres wider than napoléon with draught of metre the ship had volume of just under m³ the engine provided by the indret workshop occupied metre long compartment and was designed for shp but could develop up to shp in peak power from eight boilers each with six furnaces though direct transmission by an axis it moved four blade metre propeller which could be retracted into vertical shaft only metre wide thanks to the geometry of the blades the ship carried tonnes of coal giving her an autonomy of days at knots and days at her top speed of knots with three month worth of food for the man complement and one month worth fresh water completed by distillation device to desalinate seawater she could stay at sea for days the main battery of bretagne used pounder long guns the heaviest available calibre instead of the more modern pounder long gun on which other ships standardised their armament the aft of the ship was round and featured gun ports like on napoléon on her successors although she carried guns of various calibres bretagne featured no less than gun ports this allowed the crew to reinforce the artillery on one arc if needed and time permitting such as before shore bombardment and fire up to guns on one target the figurehead figured the prophet veleda an important character in the folklore of bretagne with sickle in hand and wearing an oak leaf crown the transom featured the coat of arms of bretagne carried by two geniī and the name of the ship underneath the ship was painted in black with white stripes along the level of the gunports and copper red paint underwater as completed bretagne proved much heavier than anticipated designed to displace tonnes for metre draught she actually displaced yielding metre draught that lowered the lower battery to only above water instead of the intended metres daguerreotype of bretagne in brest circa the ultimate increase in french capital ship design bretagne increased the number of heavy guns on the lower battery to on each side from the of the bretagne of and on the océan in the original design half of these guns were pounder long guns as to maximise firepower at the price of standardisation on pounder long guns that typically prevailed at the time the other half being pounder paixhans guns the middle deck fielded pounder short guns and another paixhans guns of pounds the upper battery was armed with pounder howitzers two pounders and pounder caronades complemented the armament on the deck this gave bretagne broadside of pounds kilogrammes compared to the of the original océan design in after the ship became school ship for the école navale this armament was replaced with rifled cm guns on the lower deck pounder guns riffled centimetre guns of the pattern

visit the installations as token of good faith the visit was counter productive as the display of power of the french fleet compounded by bouts of diplomatic clumsiness such as inaugurating an

release of seventeen chinese uighurs from guantánamo bay detention camp the uighur detainees in guantanamo the united states had previously determined that the uighurs were never terrorists and it no longer considered them enemy combatants judge urbina ruled that their detention is illegal because their indefinite detention was without cause the united states continued to detain the uighurs believing their lives would be in danger if they were released to china there was considerable political pressure from members of congress not to release the uighurs in the united states and the united states had difficult time finding another country willing to accept them eventually the republic of palau announced that it would accept the remaining uighurs on temporary basis in june brown announced that he had secretly made deal with the united states to accept four of the uighurs who arrived on the island over night on humanitarian grounds he also promised to make them bermudian nationals see also belonger status the agreement to accept the uighurs angered the government of the united kingdom which was deliberately not informed about the proposed agreement the government of the united kingdom maintains that it has the authority over the acceptance of the uighurs because agreements between bermuda and foreign nations are strictly under the united kingdom control the government of bermuda responded that the acceptance of the uighurs is an immigration case and thus an internal matter the decision was kept secret from brown cabinet deputy premier paula cox claimed she had been politically neutered the governor and the bermuda police service which would be responsible for any security concerns the opposition ubp tabled motion of no confidence against brown the next day saying that the premier actions violated the constitution of bermuda and bordered on dictatorship brown responded by saying that the firestorm would pass and that his position was not in danger but that he regretted the response to his actions the following week protest march was organised by plp member to oppose brown continuing premiership which was dismissed by brown resignation

      "the tambaqui colossoma macropomum is large species of freshwater fish in the family serrasalmidae it is native to tropical south america but kept in aquaculture and introduced elsewhere it is also known by the names black pacu black finned pacu giant pacu cachama gamitana and sometimes as pacu name used for several other related species the tambaqui is currently the only member of colossoma but the two piaractus species were also included in this genus in the past distribution the tambaqui is native to freshwater habitats in the amazon and orinoco basins of tropical south america in nutrient rich whitewater rivers such as the madeira juruá putumayo içá and purus it ranges throughout all the way up to their headwaters in nutrient poor blackwater rivers such as the rio negro and clearwater rivers such as several rightbank tributaries of the madeira it generally only occurs in the lower and is rare beyond the lowermost it is widely kept in aquaculture outside its native range in south america miocene fossils are known from the magdalena river but modern occurrence in this river is due to introductions by humans description thumb the tambaqui is the heaviest characin in the americas the lighter salminus can grow longer and the second heaviest scaled freshwater fish in south america after the arapaima it can reach up to in total length and in weight but more typical size is the largest caught by rod and reel and recognized by igfa weighed after the flood season around of tambaqui weight is the visceral fat reserves and at least another is fat found in the head and muscles it is similar in shape to the piranha and juveniles are sometimes confused with the carnivorous fish the tambaqui is tall and laterally compressed with large eyes and slightly arched back unlike more predatory species the teeth of the tambaqui are molar like an adaption for crushing plant seeds and nuts the lower half of its body is typically mainly blackish the remaining is mainly gray yellowish or olive but the exact hue varies considerably and depends in part on habitat with individuals in blackwater being much darker than individuals from whitewater the pelvic anal and small pectoral fins are black the tambaqui resembles the pirapitinga piaractus brachypomus but the latter species has more rounded head profile less elongated and pointed and smaller adipose fin that lacks rays as well as differences in teeth and operculum hybrids between the tambaqui and the similar piaractus both species have been produced in aquaculture and are occasionally seen in the wild the hybrid offspring can be difficult to identify by appearance alone ecology habitat breeding and migration this species is mostly solitary but it migrates in large schools during the non breeding season adults stay in flooded forests of white várzea clear and blackwater igapó rivers they stay there for four to seven months during the flood season but as the water level drops they move into the main river channels or to lesser extent floodplain lakes at the start of the next flood season large schools move into whitewater rivers where they spawn between november and february the exact spawning location in the whitewater rivers is not entirely certain but apparently along woody shores or grassy levees the schools then break up as the adults return to the flooded forest of white clear and blackwater rivers and the annual pattern is repeated larvae are found in whitewater rivers including the amazon river itself juveniles stay near macrophytes in floodplains and flooded forests year round only switching to the adult migration pattern when reaching sexual maturity maturity is reached at length of about the species regularly reaches an age of years and may reach up to oxygen salt and ph resistance when there is not enough oxygen in the river or lake tambaqui obtain oxygen from the air they are able to do this by their physical and inner body parts such as their gills and swim bladder vascularization tambaqui is fish that lives in freshwater juveniles can survive in brackish water when the salinity is gradually raised salinity levels above result in death when juveniles are reared in salinities above there is significant detrimental effect on growth haematological parameters and osmoregulatory in an experiment tambaqui had the ph of their water changed no deaths occurred to tambaqui if the ph did not fall to the only internal difference that was noted in tambaqui when the ph was being altered was change in the acid base of the plasma and red cells diet tambaqui consume fruits and seeds especially from woody angiosperms and herbaceous species depending on the quantity and food quality of these foods it causes the fish to decide on their location of their habitat in one study during the high water season percent of the diet consisted of fruits another study of the stomach content of specimens during the high water season found that of the weight was fruits and seeds was zooplankton and was wild rice among specimens during the low water season higher percentage had empty stomachs about ten times more than in the high water season and about of the total stomach content weight was zooplakton in addition to seeds fruits wild rice and zooplakton smaller levels of insects snails shrimps small fish filamentous algae and decaying plants are consumed seed dispersal the tambaqui plays an important role in dispersing plant seeds the fruit seeds that fall in the water are consumed by tambaqui and the seed is dispersed somewhere else this is similar to what birds do this consumption includes about of the trees and lianas during flood season and these seeds can grow after the floodwater calms down compared to the younger and smaller tambaqui larger and older tambaqui are able to disperse the seeds in faster rate the gut of well fed tambaqui can contain more than seeds in general more seeds are able to pass undamaged through the pirapitinga piaractus brachypomus than the tambaqui meaning that the former overall is more efficient seed disperser relationship to humans the flesh of the tambaqui is popular and fetches top prices in fish markets in its native range it is marketed fresh and frozen wild populations of the tambaqui have declined because of overfishing and many currently caught fish are juveniles in manaus alone the landings fell from per year in the to in based on review by ibama it was the th most caught fish by weight in the brazilian amazon in just ahead of the closely related pirapitinga piaractus brachypomus the tambaqui is now widely kept in aquaculture it can live in oxygen poor waters and is very resistant to diseases in brazil tambaqui is one of the main fish species that is farmed and therefore important to the country economy studies of farmed tambaqui in brazil have revealed genetic diversity similar to that seen among wild populations in fish farms this species is sometimes hybridized with piaractus to produce offspring that accept wider temperature range colder water than pure tambaqui in thailand this fish known locally as pla khu dam ปลาค ดำ was introduced from hong kong and singapore as part of fish farming projects but has adapted to local conditions and thrives in the wild in some areas there is also an introduced population in puerto rico and singles likely deliberate releases by aquarists have been caught in wide range of states but only those in the warmest regions can survive juveniles long sometimes labelled as vegetarian piranha are frequently seen

game weapons are no more regarded as instruments of destruction rather defrag players use them as tools for moving around gamespace this transformation of first person shooter into vehicle for virtual gymnastics meanwhile has gradually been recognized by mainstream media it is thrown into the public discourse as counterweight to the stereotype of computer games fostering violent behaviour the defrag mod stars prominently in this movie making the high skill requirement of the game along with the fast pace cause that game movies are often made using content created by playing defrag game modes within the community tradition especially the fastest runs difficult trickjumping techniques are included in sequence the defrag demo playback system includes settings to view the primary player from various angles and perspectives this is in line with the history of the machinima phenomenon which originates from the speedrun community of quake the first game in the series by following the argumentation of stanford historian of science and technology henry lowood defrag can be called an instance of transformative high performance play some of these movies won gaming industry awards for instance the freestyle trickjumping movie tricking it by jethro brewin jrb won five golden llamas awards in the categories were best picture best audio best tech best editing and direction and best quake movie in the following year the trick stunt movie reaching aural nirvana by mrks won golden llamas award in the category best audio also in the art house short movie defragged directed by margit nobis an instance of machinima its name is borrowed from the defrag mod was shown at numerous prestigious festivals including the vienna independent shorts festival gameplay major versions history unstable september unstable july january october october march april july october august march january all maps share the common objective of finishing in the fastest time possible but there are variations on how this is achieved run mode is flat out race which the objective is to finish line in accuracy mode map is completed after certain number of targets have been hit with the railgun sniper rifle level mode is similar to run but map provide number of alternative ways of reaching the finish line in fast caps mode the time is measured since the flag has been taken training mode usually requires the successful usage of particular technique in order to complete the level there also freestyle maps without primary objective but where the player may practise particular techniques the type of map can usually be seen in its name although some do not follow this convention there are two game physics and ruleset modes vanilla quake vq and challenge promode cpm vq is an original physics and game ruleset cpm is an altered game physics delivered from challenge promode arena modification it provides gamemode which includes physics allowing for better air control rebalanced weapons fast weapon switching and improvements of jumping techniques techniques the completion of defrag map requires the use of variety of trickjumping techniques most training maps involve only one or two methods but some more complicated run and level maps can require any number various map sections can require quick timing combination and flawless execution of several techniques jumping techniques jumping techniques allows player to move faster farther and or jump higher the most common techniques included in and defrag itself includes bunny hopping air strafing strafe jumping circle jumping ramp jumping etc bunny hopping is the most basic method of fast movement in which player is jumping repeatedly instead of running in order to move faster strafe jumping sj is technique necessary to complete the majority of defrag maps and is considered to be the most fundamental technique in trick jumping it is only possible because of specificity of the game physics unintentionally allowing moving vectors to add up to greater acceleration basically no matter if the player character is moving on the ground running or is airborne jumping the game engine always strives to limit its speed however already in the original quake it was discovered that by non trivial timed sequences of striking the direction keys involving moving sideways strafing in gamer language and movements of the mouse this limitation of speed could be overcome as the quake engines are the basis of many games the possibility of strafe jumping is existing within other games too but trickjumping community developed several distinct sub techniques including single beat strafe jumping single beat strafe jumping with airchange double beat strafe jumping half beat strafe jumping and inverted strafe jumping the defrag mod includes helping tool the camping gaz head up display cgazhud which provides conveniently graphically formatted real time feedback on acceleration and angles involved circle jumping cj is based on the same principles as strafe jumping circle jumping more often than not is used as the starting technique for strafe jumping run another technique involves ramped surfaces and it called ramp jumping jumping on ramped surface gives height boost air strafing can be done when the player is in the air simply keeping him herself aligned at the optimal angle in relation to where the player wants to go making the player go farther and faster whilst airborne one of the methods for reaching difficult places weapon techniques weapon jumping techniques requires the player jumps off the ground and by using the proper weapon immediately afterwards fires bullet rocket grenade plasma or bfg plasma onto the spot on the floor exactly or very near beneath her him the damage of the resulting blast delivers momentum to the player character and propels her him higher into the air than possible by regular jumping the gain in momentum can be used for vertical horizontal and diagonal movement in four weapons makes self splash damage and can be combined with each other rocket and grenade launcher bfg and plasma gun rocket jumping rj is the only tricking technique using weapon that can commonly be observed in professional deathmatch competition in spite of the resulting cost in health with self inflicting splash damage enabled in this game mode depending on the size and topography of the map and proper synchronisation two or larger number of rockets can be timed to impact on the very same spot fraction of second or th after the player arrives there thus the player can capitalize on the added momentum furnished by the detonation of multiple projectiles accelerate substantially and travel long distances airborne when playing in defrag multiplayer mode projectiles fired by other players can be used as well grenade jumping gj is technique which demands more exacting timing because the grenade launcher projectile ricochets after it is launched and its detonation is delayed combining more than one grenade in order to make gj is also possible but may require more players due to detonation delay bfg jumping is technique kin to rocket jumping and only insofar different as the bfg has higher rate of fire and makes more splash damage plasma jumping also called plasma hopping is technique in which plasma gives slight boost to the jump team tricking weapon jumpings requires teamwork with minimum one additional player in defrag every weapon can be used in this technique the other player weapon may deliver additional momentum most common team techniques includes gauntlet rocket grenade and rail jumping the plasma gun can be used to climb along walls technique called plasma climbing the vertical climb is the most basic variant the successive recoil of the gun rapid fire then lifts the player up the wall by various combinations of direction keys and mouselook horizontal and diagonal paths are possible as well expert performers can change the directions of travel en route climb down and up again climb along curved walls and hit high walls from mid air to plasma climb in any direction techniques exploiting bugs techniques exploiting bugs capitalize on flaws in the game engine which in some maps lend special qualities to certain locations resulting in physics anomalies if at particular spots the player falls from certain height to the ground they will be catapulted up again although no jumppad is present the technique is named overbounce overbounces can be combined with weapon techniques the defrag mod includes an overbounce detector tool helping the player to identify locations in maps where an overbounce is possible variety of overbounce opportunities has been discovered made into techniques and have been named accordingly vertical horizontal sticky diagonal weird zero ups diagonal and slippery diagonal overbounce at certain locations when player steps near wall and jumps to it she he will end up sticking to the wall in mid air now the player can perform speed gaining technique like strafe jumping without her his character moving from the spot but accelerating nevertheless this is real anomaly as the player character does not move in gamespace but the game engine ascribes ever higher speed to it the player then can unstick from the wall by firing splash damage weapon into it and subsequently will move with the speed gained on the spot this technique is called sticky wall or rebounce notes references external links defrag download df org community former official website cggdev org at internet

      "takotsubo cardiomyopathy also known as stress cardiomyopathy is type of non ischemic cardiomyopathy in which there is sudden temporary weakening of the muscular portion of the heart this weakening may be triggered by emotional stress such as the death of loved one break up rejection from partner or constant anxiety this leads to one of the common names broken heart syndrome stress cardiomyopathy is now well recognized cause of acute heart failure lethal ventricular arrhythmias and ventricular rupture the name takotsubo syndrome comes from the japanese word octopus trap because the left ventricle takes on shape resembling fishing pot signs and symptoms the typical presentation of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is chest pain associated with ecg changes mimicking myocardial infarction of the anterior wall during the course of evaluation of the patient bulging out of the left ventricular apex with base of the left ventricle is often noted it is the hallmark bulging out of the apex of the heart with preserved function of the base that earned the syndrome its name octopus trap in japan where it was first described stress is the main factor in takotsubo cardiomyopathy with more than of cases set in motion by either physically or emotionally stressful event that prefaces the start of symptoms examples of emotional stressors include grief from the death of loved one fear of public speaking arguing with spouse relationship disagreements betrayal and financial problems acute asthma surgery chemotherapy and stroke are examples of physical stressors in few cases the stress may be happy event such as wedding winning jackpot sporting triumph or birthday takotsubo cardiomyopathy is more commonly seen in postmenopausal women often there is history of recent severe usually negative sometimes happy emotional or physical stress causes the cause of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is not fully understood but several mechanisms have been proposed transient vasospasm some of the original researchers of takotsubo suggested that multiple simultaneous spasms of coronary arteries could cause enough loss of blood flow to cause transient stunning of the myocardium other researchers have shown that vasospasm is much less common than initially thought it has been noted that when there are vasospasms even in multiple arteries that they do not correlate with the areas of myocardium that are not contracting microvascular dysfunction the theory gaining the most traction is that there is dysfunction of the coronary arteries at the level where they are no longer visible by coronary angiography this could include microvascular vasospasm however it may well have some similarities to diseases such as diabetes mellitus in such disease conditions the microvascular arteries fail to provide adequate oxygen to the myocardium mid ventricular obstruction apical stunning it has been suggested that mid ventricular wall thickening with outflow obstruction is important in the pathophysiology catecholamine induced myocyte injury it has been suggested that the response to catecholamines such as epinephrine and norepinephrine released in response to stress leads to heart muscle dysfunction that contributes to takotsubo cardiomyopathy it is likely that there are multiple factors at play that could include some amount of vasospasm and failure of the case series looking at large groups of patients report that some patients develop takotsubo cardiomyopathy after an emotional stress while others have preceding clinical stressor such as an asthma attack or sudden illness roughly one third of patients have no preceding stressful event large case series from europe found that takotsubo cardiomyopathy was slightly more frequent during the winter season this may be related to two possible suspected causes coronary spasms of microvessels which are more prevalent in cold weather and viral infections such as parvovirus which occur more frequently during the winter diagnosis transient apical ballooning syndrome or takotsubo cardiomyopathy is found in of patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome while the original case studies reported on individuals in japan takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been noted more recently in the united states and western europe it is likely that the syndrome previously went undiagnosed before it was described in detail in the japanese literature evaluation of individuals with takotsubo cardiomyopathy typically includes coronary angiogram to rule out occlusion of the left anterior descending artery which will not reveal any significant blockages that would cause the left ventricular dysfunction provided that the individual survives their initial presentation the left ventricular function improves within two months the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy may be difficult upon presentation the ecg findings often are confused with those found during an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction it classically mimics st segment elevation myocardial infarction and is characterised by acute onset of transient ventricular apical wall motion abnormalities ballooning accompanied by chest pain shortness of breath st segment elevation wave inversion or qt interval prolongation on ecg cardiac enzymes are usually negative and are moderate at worst and cardiac catheterization usually shows absence of significant coronary artery disease the diagnosis is made by the pathognomonic wall motion abnormalities in which the base of the left ventricle is contracting normally or is hyperkinetic while the remainder of the left ventricle is akinetic or dyskinetic this is accompanied by the lack of significant coronary artery disease that would explain the wall motion abnormalities although apical ballooning has been described classically as the angiographic manifestation of takotsubo it has been shown that left ventricular dysfunction in this syndrome includes not only the classic apical ballooning but also different angiographic morphologies such as mid ventricular ballooning and rarely local ballooning of other segments the ballooning patterns were classified by shimizu et al as takotsubo type for apical akinesia and basal hyperkinesia reverse takotsubo for basal akinesia and apical hyperkinesia mid ventricular type for mid ventricular ballooning accompanied by basal and apical hyperkinesia and localised type for any other segmental left ventricular ballooning with clinical characteristics of takotsubo like left ventricular dysfunction in short the main criteria for the diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy are the patient must have experienced stressor before the symptoms began to arise the patient ecg reading must show abnormalities from normal heart the patient must not show signs of coronary blockage or other common causes of heart troubles the levels of cardiac enzymes in the heart must be elevated or irregular and the patient must recover complete contraction and be functioning normally in short amount of time image takotsubo gif left during systole showing apical ballooning akinesis with basal hyperkinesis in characteristic takotsubo ventricle

jpeg ecg showing sinus tachycardia and non specific st and wave changes from person with confirmed takotsubo cardiomyopathy file uotw ultrasound of the week webm echocardiogram showing the effects of the disease treatment the treatment of takotsubo cardiomyopathy is generally supportive in nature for it is considered transient disorder treatment is dependent on whether patients experience heart failure or acute hypotension and shock in many individuals left ventricular function normalizes within two months aspirin and other heart drugs also appear to help in the treatment of this disease even in extreme cases after the patient has been diagnosed and myocardial infarction heart attack ruled out the aspirin regimen may be discontinued and treatment becomes that of supporting the patient while medical treatments are important to address the acute symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy further treatment includes lifestyle changes it is important that the individual stay physically healthy while learning and maintaining methods to manage stress and to cope with future difficult situations although the symptoms of takotsubo cardiomyopathy usually go away on their own and the condition completely resolves itself within few weeks some serious complications can happen that must be treated these most commonly include congestive heart failure and very low blood pressure and less commonly include blood clotting in the apex of the left ventricle irregular heart beat and tearing of the heart wall heart failure for patients in acute heart failure ace inhibitors angiotensin receptor blockers and beta blockers are considered mainstays of heart failure treatment but use of beta blockers specifically for takotsubo cardiomyopathy is controversial because they may confer no benefit low blood pressure for people with cardiogenic shock medical treatment is based on whether left ventricular outflow tract lvot obstruction is present therefore early is necessary to determine proper management for those with obstructed lvots inotropic agents should not be used but instead should be managed like patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy phenylephrine and fluid resuscitation for cases in which the lvot is not obstructed inotropic therapy dobutamine and dopamine may be used but with the consideration that takotsubo is caused by excess catecholamines furthermore mechanical support with an intra aortic balloon pump iabp is well established as supportive treatment prognosis despite the grave initial presentation in some of the patients most of the patients survive the initial acute event with very low rate of in hospital mortality or complications once patient has recovered from the acute stage of the syndrome they can expect favorable outcome and the long term prognosis is excellent even when ventricular systolic function is heavily compromised at presentation it typically improves within the first few days and normalises within the first few months although infrequent recurrence of the syndrome has been reported and seems to be associated with the nature of the trigger epidemiology takotsubo cardiomyopathy is rare affecting between and of people in japan and to in western countries who suffer myocardial infarction it also affects far more women than men with of cases being women most postmenopausal scientists believe one reason is that estrogen causes the release of catecholamine and glucocorticoid in response to mental stress it is not likely for the same recovered patient to experience the syndrome twice although it has happened in rare cases the average ages at onset are between and years less than of cases occurred in patients under age history the japanese octopus traps after which this disease is named although the first scientific description of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was not until the cebelin and hirsch wrote about human stress cardiomyopathy in the two looked at homicidal assaults that had happened in cuyahoga county ohio the past years specifically those with autopsies who had no internal injury but had died of physical assault they found that of had myofibrillar degeneration similar to animal stress studies in the end they concluded their data supported the theory of catecholamine mediation of these myocardial changes in man and of the lethal potential of stress through its effect on the heart the first studied case of takotsubo cardiomyopathy was in japan in by sato et al more cases of the syndrome appeared in japan within the next decade although western medicine had still not acknowledged it the syndrome finally occurred in when pavin et al wrote about two cases of reversible lv dysfunction precipitated by acute emotional stress the western world had not heard of such thing at the time as it was incredibly rare and often misdiagnosed the japanese at last reported about the syndrome to the west in under the name transient lv apical ballooning though at this point the west had already heard of numerous cases the syndrome reached international audiences through the media in when the new england journal of medicine wrote about the syndrome cultural references

      "an animation of the game being played quantum tic tac toe is quantum generalization of tic tac toe in which the players moves are superpositions of plays in the classical game the game was invented by allan goff of novatia labs who describes it as way of introducing quantum physics without mathematics and offering conceptual foundation for understanding the meaning of quantum mechanics background the motivation to invent quantum tic tac toe was to explore what it means to be in two places at once in classical physics single object cannot be in two places at once in quantum physics however the mathematics used to describe quantum systems seems to imply that before being subjected to quantum measurement or observed certain quantum particles can be in multiple places at once the textbook example of this is the double slit experiment how the universe can be like this is rather there is disconnect between the mathematics and our mental images of reality disconnect that is absent in classical physics this is why quantum mechanics supports multiple interpretations the researchers who invented quantum tic tac toe were studying abstract quantum systems formal systems whose axiomatic foundation included only few of the axioms of quantum mechanics quantum tic tac toe became the most thoroughly studied abstract quantum system and offered insights that spawned new research it also turned out to be fun and engaging game game which also provides good pedagogy in the classroom the rules of quantum tic tac toe attempt to capture three phenomena of quantum systems superposition the ability of quantum objects to be in two places at once entanglement the phenomenon where distant parts of quantum system display correlations that cannot be explained by either timelike causality or common cause collapse the phenomenon where the quantum states of system are reduced to classical states collapses occur when measurement happens but the mathematics of the current formulation of quantum mechanics is silent on the measurement process many of the interpretations of quantum mechanics derive from different efforts to deal with the measurement problem gameplay the second player has just made move the first player must now choose whether to collapse into the upper right square or the middle square either way is going to get tic tac toe has chosen to collapse into the middle square which forces the rest of the entanglements to collapse this gives his own tic tac toe but since the maximum subscript of namely is less than the maximum subscript of namely gets one point while gets only one half point still wins quantum tic tac toe captures the three quantum phenomena discussed above by modifying one basic rule of classical tic tac toe the number of marks allowed in each square additional rules specify when and how set of marks collapses into classical moves on each move the current player marks two squares with their letter or instead of one and each letter or is subscripted with the number of the move beginning counting with the pair of marks are called spooky marks because always moves first the subscripts on are always odd and the subscripts on are always even for example player first move might be to place in both the upper left and lower right squares the two squares thus marked are called entangled during the game there may be as many as eight spooky marks in single square if the square is entangled with all eight other squares the phenomenon of collapse is captured by specifying that cyclic entanglement causes measurement cyclic entanglement is cycle in the entanglement graph for example if square is entangled via move with square and square is entangled via move with square and square is in turn entangled via move with square then these three squares form cyclic entanglement at the end of the turn on which the cyclic entanglement was created the player whose turn it is not that is the player who did not create the cycle chooses one of two ways to measure the cycle and thus cause all the entangled squares to collapse into classical tic tac toe moves in the preceding example since player created the cycle player decides how to measure it player two options are collapses into square this forces to collapse into square and to collapse into square collapses into square this forces to collapse into square and to collapse into square any other chains of entanglements hanging off the cycle would also collapse at this time for example if square were also entangled via with square then either measurement above would force to collapse into square note that it is impossible for two or more cyclic entanglements to be created in single turn when move collapses into single square that square is permanently marked in larger print with the letter and subscript of the collapsed move classical mark square containing classical mark is fixed for the rest of the game no more spooky marks may be placed in it the first player to achieve tic tac toe three in row horizontally vertically or diagonally consisting entirely of classical marks is declared the winner since it is possible for single measurement to collapse the entire board and give classical tic tac toes to both players simultaneously the rules declare that the player whose tic tac toe has the lower maximum subscript earns one point and the player whose tic tac toe has the higher maximum subscript earns only one half point see also quantum game theory references external links quantum tic tac toe iphone app quantum tic tac

      "fluid construction grammar fcg is an open source computational construction grammar formalism that allows computational linguists to formally write down the inventory of lexical and grammatical constructions as well as to do experiments in language learning and language evolution fcg is an open instrument that can be used by construction grammarians who want to formulate their intuitions and data in precise way and who want to test the implications of their grammar designs for language parsing production and learning the formalism can be tested through an interactive web interface at the fcg website fcg integrates many notions from contemporary computational linguistics such as feature structure and unification based language processing but uses them in novel way to operationalize insights from construction grammar theory constructions are considered bi directional and hence usable both for parsing and production processing is flexible in the sense that fcg provides meta layer processing for coping with novelty partially ungrammatical or incomplete sentences fcg is called fluid because it acknowledges the premise that language users constantly change and update their grammars the research on fcg is primarily carried out by luc steels and his teams at the vub ai lab in brussels and the language evolution lab in barcelona and the sony computer science laboratories in paris besides steels current and former contributors to the fcg formalism include katrien beuls paul van eecke remi van trijp joris bleys joachim de beule martin loetzsch nicolas neubauer michael spranger wouter van den broeck pieter wellens and others transient structure fcg treats parsing and production as search problem in which the fcg engine searches for the best utterance to verbalize meaning language production or the best semantic network or meaning representation to analyze an utterance parsing each state representation in the search process is called transient structure transient structure can be considered as an extended feature structure as it consists of flat list of units that consist of unit name unique constant symbol and unit body set of feature value pairs older versions of fcg before used to split the transient structure into two separate poles for semantics and syntax but the current version implements single representation for all linguistic information constructions fcg constructions or technically speaking construction schemas are treated as the operators of the search process that is by applying construction to transient structure new transient structure or state representation in the search space may be created just like transient structures constructions mostly consists of units of feature value pairs constructions are however more structured because they contain two distinct parts conditional part this part of the construction specifies the conditions under which the construction may apply moreover units of features that appear in the conditional part are split into comprehension lock and formulation lock this split is important for ensuring the bidirectional application of an fcg construction see below contributing part this part of the construction specifies information that the construction may add to the transient structure if the conditions for application are satisfied linguistic processing to decide whether construction can apply the conditional part is matched against the current transient structure using unification based algorithm in production only features that are part of the formulation locks of the construction must be matched against the transient structure whereas in parsing only features that are part of the comprehension locks will be considered if match is successful the fcg engine will merge all of the units of feature value pairs with the transient structure in similar unification based process flexibility fcg features meta layers of diagnostics repairs and consolidation strategies that allow the grammar designer to implement ways to handle novelty errors and unexpected input during processing these diagnostics and repairs can also be used for exploring
